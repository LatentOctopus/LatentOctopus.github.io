<h3>Why should you listen to me?</h3>

No reason in particular! I am a level 6 
(difficulty 8-11) true solo player (1 Spirit) like many 
others out there. I don't play at impressive
 difficulties like double 6 Adversaries,
 I don't usually play multiple Spirits at once, and I don't 
generally have exceptional win rates. 
I just like to analyse, theorycraft and
 learn how to improve, so I started taking
 notes and I thought that I could share 
them with other people. Some of the 
guides are more tentative, some other 
are more established, but all of them
 are subject to change as I gain more 
experience with the Spirit -- you never 
stop learning! Hopefully you'll find at 
least some of them useful :)
<br/><br/>

<h3>Who are these guides for?</h3>

As I said above, this website is more similar
to sharing my notes than to explicitly teach
other players (e.g. by providing basic advice like "stop the Invaders
 cycle early"). As a result, I think the
people that are going to get the most out of it
are medium-high difficulty players that want 
some pointers about what
works for a Spirit, and start from there to
find what strategy works best for them.
With that being said, everyone is welcome here,
and I might decide to add a "Beginner tips"
 section 
in the future if that's going to be useful!

<h3>Which Spirits should I expect to find guides for?</h3>

Eventually, all of them! By this I don't mean that I'll
necessarily write a guide for every Spirit, but I aim to
include valuable external resources as well, both for Spirits
that I play and for the ones I don't. 

If you're interested in what Spirits I plan to write guides for,
here's a tier list according to how much I enjoy each Spirit
(N/A means I've never played it). Higher-ranking Spirits
are more likely to receive a guide, but... you never know :D
