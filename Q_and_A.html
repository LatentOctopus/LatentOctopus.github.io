<h3>Why should you listen to me?</h3>

No reason in particular! I am a level 6 true solo player (difficulty 8-11, 1 Spirit) like many others out there. I don't play at impressive
difficulties like double 6 Adversaries, I don't usually play multiple Spirits at once, and I don't generally have exceptional win rates. 
I just like to analyse, theorycraft and learn how to improve, so I started taking notes and I thought that I could share them with other people. 
Some of the guides are more tentative, some other are more established (see the legend <a href='/glossary#confidence'>here</a>), but all of them
are subject to change as I gain more experience with the Spirit -- you never stop learning! Hopefully you'll find at least some of them useful :)
<br/><br/>

<h3>Who are these guides for?</h3>

As I said above, this website is more similar to sharing my notes than to explicitly teach other players (e.g. by providing basic advice 
like "stop the Invaders cycle early"). As a result, I think the people that are going to get the most out of it are medium-high difficulty 
players that want some pointers about what works for a Spirit, and start from there to find what strategy works best for them.
With that being said, everyone is welcome here, and I might decide to add a "Beginner tips" section in the future if that's going to be useful!
<br/><br/>

<h3>Should I follow your guides to a T?</h3>

Absolutely not! Nor any guide, in my opinion. These are just my thoughts, and might not align with your way of thinking or playing the game. Even
when they do, every game is different, and adaptability is a necessary skill in a complex game like Spirit Island. In my openings I will write 
suggestions for the early and mid game (5-6 turns) and sometimes more, but ultimately that is just to show the direction of the strategy, and provide
some statistics to help analyze the strategy in a more objective fashion. You should rarely just do exacly as written!
<br/><br/>

<h3>Which Spirits should I expect to find guides for?</h3>

Eventually, all of them! By this I don't mean that I'll necessarily write a guide for every Spirit, but I aim to include valuable 
external resources as well, both for Spirits that I play and for the ones I don't. 
<br/><br/>

If you're interested in what Spirits I plan to write guides for, here's a tier list according to how much I enjoy each Spirit. 
Higher-ranking Spirits are more likely to receive a guide, but... you never know :D
