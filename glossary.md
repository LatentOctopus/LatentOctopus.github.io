### Abbreviations

*  **G**n (e.g. G2):  the n-th growth options, starting from 1 going left to right. For Green, the "Always" growth is called G0.
* n**E** (e.g. 2E): n energy/turn.
* n**CP** (e.g. 3CP): n card plays.
* **x/y** (e.g. 2/4): x energy/turn and y card plays.
* **CE**: Cumulative Energy. See [Stats](#Stats) below for its meaning.

### Opening names

Referring to presence placement:

* **Full top/bottom track**: the opening focuses on emptying one of the tracks, taking one or no presence from the other one.
* **Top/bottom track**: the opening mostly takes presence from one track, and only occasionally from the other one.
* **Hybrid**: presence is taken from both tracks more or less equally. Sometimes this can be written as **Top/bottom track hybrid** to signal the early-game focus, which is useful e.g. to know what other opening one can pivot to if the game takes an unexpected turn.
              
    
Referring to Power cards gains: **Minor** (no Major, or only gain Majors late in the game), **Major** (find good Majors ASAP), **Mixed**.
              
### Stats

I'll often report stats in an opening in a table like this:

Turn | Growth | Owned cards | Cards in hand | CE
:--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: 
1 | 2 |   5   | 5 | 2
2 | 3 |   5   | 3 | 6

The columns of these table are:

* **Turn**: the turn the row refers to.
* **Growth(s)**: the growth option that is typically selected.
* **Owned cards**: the total number of cards owned by the player, including the discard, _after_ all cards gained during growth.
* **Cards in hand**: the number cards available to play, _after_ gaining and reclaiming. Note that, unless otherwise specified in the opening, this assumes that all card plays are used on the previous turn.
* **CE (Cumulative energy)**: the total amount of energy gained so far in the game _via growth_, i.e. escluding Power Card gains, unless otherwise specified.
    * _Why do you not report the energy available on that turn?_ Because that depends on card gains, thus being too variable to strategise on.

Other Spirit-specific columns may be added, but these will be present most of the time.


### Credits

Many other people post guides online, and there may be overlaps with mine. In this case I'll credit the other guide in one of two ways:

- **Adapted from X** means that I've read X and tried it before writing my notes. X was instrumental for my guide, which may even be largely the same as X, or a simplified version!
- **Same as X** / **Similar to X** means that my guide was developed independently from X. It just happened that someone else uses a similar or identical strategy and posted it online. Even it X was online before I uploaded the guide, I had not read it when I came up with it.
