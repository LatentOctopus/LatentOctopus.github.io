### Abbreviations

*  **G**n (e.g. G2):  the n-th growth options, starting from 1 going left to right. For Green, the "Always" growth is called G0.
* n**E** (e.g. 2E): n energy/turn.
* n**CP** (e.g. 3CP): n card plays.
* **x/y** (e.g. 2/4): x energy/turn and y card plays.

### Opening names

Referring to presence placement:

* **Full top/bottom track**: the opening focuses on emptying one of the tracks, taking one or no presence from the other one.
* **Top/bottom track**: the opening mostly takes presence from one track, and only occasionally from the other one.
* **Hybrid**: presence is taken from both tracks more or less equally. Sometimes this can be written as **Top/bottom track hybrid** to signal the early-game focus, which is useful e.g. to know what other opening one can pivot to if the game takes an unexpected turn.
              
    
Referring to Power cards gains: **Minor** (no Major, or only gain Majors late in the game), **Major** (find good Majors ASAP), **Mixed**.
