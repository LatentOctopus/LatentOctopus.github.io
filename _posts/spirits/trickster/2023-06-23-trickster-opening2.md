## Bottom track (Minors)

### Growth

#### Turn 1

(((0-1)))

G3; G2 bottom. Priorities forthe Minor are:

1. {{m}}{{a}}, preferably 0-cost
3. {{a}}
4. {{m}} 
5. anything else

Depending on what you hav3 found, play:

1. If {{m}}{{a}}, either:
  a. (if the Minor costs 0) the Minor and [[Overenthusiastic arson]]
  b. [[Impersonate authority]] and [[Incite the mob]]
2. If found {{a}}: [[Overenthusiastic arson]] and the Minor if it costs 0, else [[Impersonate authority]]
3. If found {{m}}: [[Unexpected tigers]] and [[Overenthusiastic arson]].

[[Let's see what happens]] level 1 is unlocked in case 1.


#### Turn 2

(((0-2)))
G2 bottom; G3.

Play 3 with 2{{m}}1{{f}}2{{a}} to unlock [[Let's see what happens]] level 2. Forget, preferably from the discard, to gain the new Power.

#### Turn 3

(((1-2)))

Reclaim; G2 top.

Play 3. Make sure you have 2{{m}}1{{f}}2{{a}} to unlock [[Let's see what happens]] level 2.

#### Turn 4

(((1-3)))

G2 bottom;Â G3 Minor.

Play 3, unlocking [[Let's see what happens]] level 2.
    
    
#### Turn 5

(((1-4)))

Reclaim, G2 bottom.

Play 4.

#### Turn 6 onwards

Reclaim loop by taking G1 every turn, with G4 if needing Energy and G2 otherwise (usually from bottom).


### Remarks

This opening cannot reliably sustain a hand whose overall cost is more than 3. Trickster's starting hand costs 2, which means you can only use 1 extra 1-cost Minor per Reclaim cycle (2 turns), assuming you unlock [[Let's see what happens]] level 2 every turn except the first. It's therefore important to balance hand cost carefully. Failure to do so might result in having to select G4 instead of G2 (delaying 4 CP) or G3 (playing only 2 cards) on turn 4.

On turn 3, presence can be taken from the bottom track if the extra {{m}} is not needed to unlock [[Let's see what happens]] level 2. This can allow to get 4 CP on turn 4 (although only 3 will be played, unless Forgetting from play on turn 3), and starting the Reclaim loop from turn 5 by taking G1+G4.

If a 0-cost is found on turn 1, G3 can be selected on turn 2 instead of G4, and G4 can be delayed until turn 4. This restricts the cards that can be played on turn 3, but enables gaining 2 Minors in the first two turns, which is better for planning and for options to Forget for [[Let's see what happens]].

Never forget [[Incite the mob]] or [[Impersonate authority]]. Your other 2 starting cards can be Forgotten if the circumstances call for it.

### Stats

The following assumes that the card for [[Let's see what happens]] is forgotten from hand. Higher cards in hand can be achieved by forgetting from play or discard.

Turn | Growths | Owned cards | Cards in hand | CE (growth only) | CE (including previous [[Let's see what happens]]) | Ele+CP 
:--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--:
1 | 2, 3   |   5   |  5  |  1 |  1 | 2
2 | 2, 4   |   5   |  3  |  5 |  5 | 3
3 | 1, 2   |   5   |  5  |  5 |  6 | {{m}}3
4 | 2, 3   |   6   |  3  |  6 |  8 | {{m}}3
5 | 1, 2   |   6   |  6  |  6 |  9 | {{m}}4

### Pros and cons

Pros:

- High CP, achieving 3 on turn 2 and 4 on turn 5 (or even turn 4 if lucky).

Cons:

- Very tight on Energy in early and mid game.
  - Forced to take an early G4 unless lucky in Minor draw, which in turn means fewer G3.
  - Extremely reliant on Energy from [[Let's see what happens]].
  - Easily affected by Events.
- Reclaim-looping can be boring.
