## Opening

### Growth

#### Turn 1

(((1-0)))

G3; G2 top. Priorities for the Minor are

1. {{m}}{{a}}, preferably 0-cost ([possible Minors](https://sick.oberien.de/?query=Moon%2C%20air%2C%20type%3Aminor))
2. {{a}}
3. anything else

Depending on what you have found, play:

1. The following to unlock [[Let's see what happens]] level 2, otherwise any 2:
 
   a. (if the Minor costs 0) the Minor and [[Overenthusiastic arson]]

   b. [[Impersonate authority]] and [[Incite the mob]] (you'll have to forget [[Unexpected tigers]])
   
2. The Minor/[[Impersonate authority]] and [[Overenthusiastic arson]] to unlock [[Let's see what happens]] level 1.
4. The Minor and [[Unexpected tigers]]/[[Impersonate authority]]/[[Overenthusiastic arson]].

#### Turn 2

(((2-0)))

G2 top; G3 Minor.

Play 1{{m}}1{{f}}2{{a}} (plus the {{m}} on your top track) to unlock [[Let's see what happens]] level 2.

#### Turn 3

(((2-1)))

Reclaim; G2 bottom.

Play to unlock [[Let's see what happens]] level 2, e.g. [[Impersonate authority]] and [[Incite the mob]].

#### Turn 4

(((2-2)))

G2 bottom; G4.

Play 3.

#### Turn 5

(((2-3)))

Reclaim; G2 bottom.

Play 3.

#### Turn 6

(((2-4)))

G2 bottom; G3 Minor.

Play 4.

### Remarks

A Major can be gained on turn 6, as placing presence has less of a priority and thus G1+G4 can be used on turn 7.

### Stats

The following assumes that the card for [[Let's see what happens]] is forgotten from hand. Higher cards in hand can be achieved by forgetting from play or discard. It's also assumed that the level 2 of [[Let's see what happens]] is not unlocked on turn 1, although it rarely can be.

Turn | Growths | Owned cards | Cards in hand | CE (growth only) | CE (including previous [[Let's see what happens]]) | Ele+CP 
:--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--:
1 | 2, 3 |   5   |  5  |  1 |  1 | {{m}}2
2 | 2, 3 |   6   |  4  |  3 |  3 | {{m}}2
3 | 1, 2 |   6   |  6  |  4 |  6 | {{m}}2
4 | 2, 4 |   6   |  4  |  9 | 12 | {{m}}3
5 | 1, 2 |   6   |  6  | 10 | 14 | {{m}}3
6 | 2, 3 |   7   |  4  | 12 | 17 | {{m}}4

### Pros and cons

Pros:

- Comfortable in Energy, meaning that G3 and [[A real flair for discord]] can be used often, and missing out for any reason on a [[Let's see what happens]] level 2 is not too bad.
- Allows playing Majors in the mid/late game while having high CP.
- No reclaim loop.

Cons:

- Low CP: 3 only unlocked on turn 4, and 4 on turn 6.
