The idea of the following openings is to get to 2/3 and unlocking the Any element on its top track as well.

That been said, Trickster is a... tricky Spirit to write an opening for, because its growth path depends on the cards that it gains via [[Let's see what happens]] and G3. All of the following openings assume gaining a Minor via G3 as first thing on turn 1, and then choosing the option based on the elements and cost of the gained Power.


## Unique Powers reminder

{% include uniques.html spirit=spirit_tag %}

## Hybrid #1

Available if found a [{{m}}+{{a}} Minor](https://sick.oberien.de/?query=Moon%2C%20air%2C%20type%3Aminor) (even better if it costs 0).

### Growth

#### Turn 1

![](/assets/images/Trickster1-0.png)

G3; G2 top. 

Play either
1. (if {{m}}{{a}} costs 0) {{m}}{{a}} and [[Overenthusiastic arson]], or
2. [[Impersonate authority]] and [[Incite the mob]]

to unlock [[Let's see what happens]] level 2. Forget either from play or [[Unexpected tigers]] to gain the new Minor (forgetting from play is not recommended if playing pair 2).
    
#### Turn 2

![](/assets/images/Trickster1-1.png)

G2 bottom; G3.

Play the other pair to unlock [[Let's see what happens]] level 2. Forget to gain the new Power.

#### Turn 3

![](/assets/images/Trickster1-2.png)

Reclaim; G2 bottom.

Play 3. Make sure you have 2{{m}}1{{f}}2{{a}} to unlock [[Let's see what happens]] level 2.

#### Turn 4

![](/assets/images/Trickster2-2.png)

G2 top; G3 Minor.

Play 3.
    
    
#### Turn 5

![](/assets/images/Trickster3-2.png)

Reclaim; G2 top.


### Remarks

E2 can be unlocked on turn 2 if found costly Minors, moving 3 CP from turn 3 to turn 4.

On turn 4 a Major can be gained if Energy is not an issue. Otherwise, it should be gained on turn 6, at which point presence placement can be delayed and can be replaced by G4 if needed.

### Stats

The following assumes that the card for [[Let's see what happens]] is forgotten from hand. Higher cards in hand can be achieved by forgetting from play or discard.

Turn | Growths | Owned cards | Cards in hand | CE (growth only) | CE (including previous [[Let's see what happens]]) | Elements and CP 
:--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--:
1 | 2, 3   |   5   |  5  |  1 |  1 | {{m}}2
2 | 2, 3   |   6   |  4  |  2 |  3 | {{m}}2
3 | 1, 2   |   6   |  6  |  2 |  4 | {{m}}3
4 | 2, 3   |   7   |  4  |  4 |  7 | {{m}}3
5 | 1, 2   |   7   |  7  |  5 |  9 | {{m}},Any,3


## Hybrid #2

Available if found a 0-cost Minor.

### Growth

#### Turn 1

![](/assets/images/Trickster0-1.png)

G3; G2 top. 

Play the 0-cost Minor and [[Overenthusiastic arson]].


#### Turn 2

![](/assets/images/Trickster0-2.png)

G2 bottom; G3.

Play [[Unexpected tigers]], [[Impersonate authority]] and [[Incite the mob]] to unlock [[Let's see what happens]] level 2. Forget to gain the new Power.

#### Turn 3

![](/assets/images/Trickster1-2.png)

Reclaim; G2 top.

Play 3. Make sure you have 2{{m}}1{{f}}2{{a}} to unlock [[Let's see what happens]] level 2.

#### Turn 4

![](/assets/images/Trickster2-2.png)

G2 top; G3 Minor.

Play 3.
    
    
#### Turn 5

![](/assets/images/Trickster3-2.png)

Reclaim; G2 top.


### Remarks

If forgetting from discard for turn 2's [[Let's see what happens]], reclaiming may be delayed by one turn (to turn 4) by selecting G2+G3 on turn 3 and play the 3 remaining cards. Only 2 Energy will be available, so at least one 0-cost Minor needs to be found, but 1 Energy should also be kept for the next turn's reclaim. This is generally very risky, and therefore not recommended.


### Stats

The following assumes that the card for [[Let's see what happens]] is forgotten from hand. Higher cards in hand can be achieved by forgetting from play or discard.

Turn | Growths | Owned cards | Cards in hand | CE (growth only) | CE (including previous [[Let's see what happens]]) | Elements and CP

3 | 1, 2   |   6   |  6  |  2 |  3 | {{m}}3
4 | 2, 3   |   7   |  4  |  4 |  6 | {{m}}3

Turn | Growths | Owned cards | Cards in hand | CE (growth only) | CE (including previous [[Let's see what happens]]) | Elements and CP

## Bottom track (Minors)

### Growth

#### Turn 1

(((0-1)))

G3; G2 bottom. Priorities forthe Minor are:

1. {{m}}{{a}}, preferably 0-cost
3. {{a}}
4. {{m}} 
5. anything else

Depending on what you hav3 found, play:

1. If {{m}}{{a}}, either:
  a. (if the Minor costs 0) the Minor and [[Overenthusiastic arson]]
  b. [[Impersonate authority]] and [[Incite the mob]]
2. If found {{a}}: [[Overenthusiastic arson]] and the Minor if it costs 0, else [[Impersonate authority]]
3. If found {{m}}: [[Unexpected tigers]] and [[Overenthusiastic arson]].

[[Let's see what happens]] level 1 is unlocked in case 1.


#### Turn 2

(((0-2)))
G2 bottom; G3.

Play 3 with 2{{m}}1{{f}}2{{a}} to unlock [[Let's see what happens]] level 2. Forget, preferably from the discard, to gain the new Power.

#### Turn 3

(((1-2)))

Reclaim; G2 top.

Play 3. Make sure you have 2{{m}}1{{f}}2{{a}} to unlock [[Let's see what happens]] level 2.

#### Turn 4

(((1-3)))

G2 bottom; G3 Minor.

Play 3, unlocking [[Let's see what happens]] level 2.
    
    
#### Turn 5

(((1-4)))

Reclaim, G2 bottom.

Play 4.

#### Turn 6 onwards

Reclaim loop by taking G1 every turn, with G4 if needing Energy and G2 otherwise (usually from bottom).


### Remarks

This opening cannot reliably sustain a hand whose overall cost is more than 3. Trickster's starting hand costs 2, which means you can only use 1 extra 1-cost Minor per Reclaim cycle (2 turns), assuming you unlock [[Let's see what happens]] level 2 every turn except the first. It's therefore important to balance hand cost carefully. Failure to do so might result in having to select G4 instead of G2 (delaying 4 CP) or G3 (playing only 2 cards) on turn 4.

On turn 3, presence can be taken from the bottom track if the extra {{m}} is not needed to unlock [[Let's see what happens]] level 2. This can allow to get 4 CP on turn 4 (although only 3 will be played, unless Forgetting from play on turn 3), and starting the Reclaim loop from turn 5 by taking G1+G4.

If a 0-cost is found on turn 1, G3 can be selected on turn 2 instead of G4, and G4 can be delayed until turn 4. This restricts the cards that can be played on turn 3, but enables gaining 2 Minors in the first two turns, which is better for planning and for options to Forget for [[Let's see what happens]].

Never forget [[Incite the mob]] or [[Impersonate authority]]. Your other 2 starting cards can be Forgotten if the circumstances call for it.

### Stats

The following assumes that the card for [[Let's see what happens]] is forgotten from hand. Higher cards in hand can be achieved by forgetting from play or discard.

Turn | Growths | Owned cards | Cards in hand | CE (growth only) | CE (including previous [[Let's see what happens]]) | Ele+CP 
:--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--:
1 | 2, 3   |   5   |  5  |  1 |  1 | 2
2 | 2, 4   |   5   |  3  |  5 |  5 | 3
3 | 1, 2   |   5   |  5  |  5 |  6 | {{m}}3
4 | 2, 3   |   6   |  3  |  6 |  8 | {{m}}3
5 | 1, 2   |   6   |  6  |  6 |  9 | {{m}}4

### Pros and cons

Pros:

- High CP, achieving 3 on turn 2 and 4 on turn 5 (or even turn 4 if lucky).

Cons:

- Very tight on Energy in early and mid game.
  - Forced to take an early G4 unless lucky in Minor draw, which in turn means fewer G3.
  - Extremely reliant on Energy from [[Let's see what happens]].
  - Easily affected by Events.
- Reclaim-looping can be boring.
