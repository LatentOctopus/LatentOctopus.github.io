The idea of the following openings is to get to 2/3 and unlocking the Any element on its top track as well. I've found this to work better than 1/4, which is constraining and often  lacks power in the mid and late game.

That been said, Trickster is a... tricky Spirit to write an opening for, because its growth path depends on the cards that it gains via [[Let's see what happens]] and G3. All of the following openings assume gaining a Minor via G3 as first thing on turn 1, and then choosing the option based on the elements and cost of the gained Power.

## Hybrid #1

Available if found a [{{m}}+{{a}} Minor](https://sick.oberien.de/?query=Moon%2C%20air%2C%20type%3Aminor) (even better if it costs 0), referred to as [[{{m}}{{a}}]].

### Growth

#### Turn 1

![](/assets/images/Trickster1-0.png)

G3; G2 top. 

Play either
1. (if [[{{m}}{{a}}]] costs 0) [[{{m}}{{a}}]] and [[Overenthusiastic arson]], or
2. [[Impersonate authority]] and [[Incite the mob]]
to unlock [[Let's see what happens]] level 2. Forget either from play or [[Unexpected tigers]] to gain the new Minor (forgetting from play is not recommended if playing pair 2).
    
#### Turn 2

![](/assets/images/Trickster1-1.png)

G2 bottom; G3.

Play the other pair to unlock [[Let's see what happens]] level 2. Forget to gain the new Power.

#### Turn 3

![](/assets/images/Trickster1-2.png)

Reclaim; G2 bottom.

Play 3. Make sure you have 2{{m}}1{{f}}2{{a}} to unlock [[Let's see what happens]] level 2.

#### Turn 4

![](/assets/images/Trickster2-2.png)

G2 top; G3 Minor.

Play 3.
    
    
#### Turn 5

![](/assets/images/Trickster3-2.png)

Reclaim; G2 top.


### Remarks

E2 can be unlocked on turn 2 if found costly Minors, moving 3 CP from turn 3 to turn 4.

On turn 4 a Major can be gained if Energy is not an issue. Otherwise, it should be gained on turn 6, at which point presence placement can be delayed and can be replaced by G4 if needed.

### Stats

The following assumes that the card for [[Let's see what happens]] is forgotten from hand. Higher cards in hand can be achieved by forgetting from play or discard.

Turn | Growths | Owned cards | Cards in hand | CE (growth only) | CE (including previous [[Let's see what happens]]) | Elements and CP 
:--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--:
1 | 2, 3   |   5   |  5  |  1 |  1 | {{m}}2
2 | 2, 3   |   6   |  4  |  2 |  3 | {{m}}2
3 | 1, 2   |   6   |  6  |  2 |  4 | {{m}}3
4 | 2, 3   |   7   |  4  |  4 |  7 | {{m}}3
5 | 1, 2   |   7   |  7  |  5 |  9 | {{m}},Any,3


## Hybrid #2

Available if found a 0-cost Minor.

### Growth

#### Turn 1

![](/assets/images/Trickster0-1.png)

G3; G2 top. 

Play the 0-cost Minor and [[Overenthusiastic arson]].


#### Turn 2

![](/assets/images/Trickster0-2.png)

G2 bottom; G3.

Play [[Unexpected tigers]], [[Impersonate authority]] and [[Incite the mob]] to unlock [[Let's see what happens]] level 2. Forget to gain the new Power.

#### Turn 3

![](/assets/images/Trickster1-2.png)

Reclaim; G2 top.

Play 3. Make sure you have 2{{m}}1{{f}}2{{a}} to unlock [[Let's see what happens]] level 2.

#### Turn 4

![](/assets/images/Trickster2-2.png)

G2 top; G3 Minor.

Play 3.
    
    
#### Turn 5

![](/assets/images/Trickster3-2.png)

Reclaim; G2 top.


### Remarks

If forgetting from discard for turn 2's [[Let's see what happens]], reclaiming may be delayed by one turn (to turn 4) by selecting G2+G3 on turn 3 and play the 3 remaining cards. Only 2 Energy will be available, so at least one 0-cost Minor needs to be found, but 1 Energy should also be kept for the next turn's reclaim. This is generally very risky, and therefore not recommended.


### Stats

The following assumes that the card for [[Let's see what happens]] is forgotten from hand. Higher cards in hand can be achieved by forgetting from play or discard.

Turn | Growths | Owned cards | Cards in hand | CE (growth only) | CE (including previous [[Let's see what happens]]) | Elements and CP

3 | 1, 2   |   6   |  6  |  2 |  3 | {{m}}3
4 | 2, 3   |   7   |  4  |  4 |  6 | {{m}}3
