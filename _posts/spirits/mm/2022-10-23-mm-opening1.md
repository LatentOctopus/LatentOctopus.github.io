## [Tentative] Full bottom track (Minors)


This opening leverages MM's very cheap Uniques and access to double presence placement to rush high card plays.

### Growth

#### Turn 1

![](/assets/images/MM1-1.png)

G2 top+bottom. 

Play [[Ever multiplying swarm]] and another card ([[Guide the way]] is a good default). 1{{a}}2{{n}} elements.

#### Turn 2

![](/assets/images/MM1-3.png)

G2 bottom.

Play 3. 3{{a}}1{{w}}3{{n}} elements.

#### Turn 3

![](/assets/images/MM1-3.png)

Reclaim, gain Minor, prioritise {{n}} and cost 0.

Play 3. Keep at least one 1{{w}} for next turn if planning to unlock the second level of the left innate.

#### Turn 4

![](/assets/images/MM1-4.png)

G3 bottom.

Play 3. 

#### Turn 5

![](/assets/images/MM1-4.png)

Reclaim, gain Minor. Pay 2 to gain a Minor.

Play 3.

#### Turn 6

![](/assets/images/MM1-6.png)

G2 bottom.

Play 5.

#### Turn 7

![](/assets/images/MM1-6.png)

Reclaim, gain Minor. If Energy allows it, pay 2 to gain a Minor.

Play 5 or 4.

#### Turn 8

![](/assets/images/MM3-6.png)

G2 top.

Play 4 or 5.

#### Turn 9

![](/assets/images/MM3-6.png)

Reclaim, gain Minor.

Play 5.


#### Remarks

You can easily sustain a 2-cost hand during a reclaim cycle, but more than that will require slowing down your growth. Thus, 0-cost Powers should be prioritised

4 CP can be rushed on turn 4 if 0-cost Minors have been found.

On turn 6, G3 bottom can be used if your hand costs more than 2 (i.e. more than 1 1-cost Minors have been drafted).

Reclaim-looping is an option on turn 7+, since your starting hand is enough to activate all levels of both your innates. It is even an option from turn 5+ if 4 CP have been unlocked on turn 4, since all but the last level of the right Innate can be unlocked.


### Stats

A `+` in the growth means that a Power was gained by paying 2.

Turn | Growth | Owned cards | Cards in hand | CE

### Pro and cons

Pros:
 - Highest CP and card gains to match the CPs at all points of the game (or almost all if bad draws happen).
 - Starts fast and keeps up.
 - Can pivot easily to adapt to the circumstances.

Cons:
- Bad draws might require adaptation.
- Energy is tight unless some off-turns are taken (playing less than the maximum cards possible).
- G3 taken rarely, which limits range early and gives less Beasts maneuverability.
    - Less Beasts are also put on the board, but this is somewhat offset by having many sacred sites thanks to G2.
