## [Tentative] Hybrid (Mixed)


### Growth

#### Turn 1

![](/assets/images/MM1-1.png)

G2 top+bottom. 

Play [[Ever multiplying swarm]] and another card ([[Guide the way]] is a good default). 1{{a}}2{{n}} elements.

#### Turn 2

![](/assets/images/MM1-3.png)

G2 bottom.

Play 3. 3{{a}}1{{w}}3{{n}} elements.

#### Turn 3

![](/assets/images/MM1-3.png)

Reclaim, gain Minor.

Play 3. Keep at least one 1{{w}} for next turn if planning to unlock the second level of the left innate.

#### Turn 4

![](/assets/images/MM3-3.png)

G3 top.

Play 3. 

#### Turn 5


![](/assets/images/MM3-3.png)


Reclaim, gain Major.

Play 3.

#### Turn 6

![](/assets/images/MM4-3.png)

G3 top.

Play 3.

#### Turn 7

![](/assets/images/MM4-3.png)

Reclaim, gain Minor.

Play 4.

#### Turn 8

![](/assets/images/MM4-5.png)

G2 top.

Play 4.

#### Turn 9

![](/assets/images/MM4-5.png)

Reclaim, gain Minor.

Play 4.


#### Remarks

The Major gain can be moved from turn 5 to turn 4 by paying 2 Energy and forgetting from discard.

If Energy allows it, an extra card can be gained on turn 5 by paying 2. This can be used to replace the Major if bad, or to gain a Minor to threshold the Major.

G2 top can be selected on turn 6 if Energy is a concern going forward.


### Stats

A `+` in the growth means that a Power was gained by paying 2.

Turn | Growth | Owned cards | Cards in hand | CE 
:--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |  :--:
1 | 2 |   5   |  5  |  1 
2 | 2 |   5   |  3  |  2
3 | 1 |   6   |  6  |  3
4 | 2 |   6   |  3  |  5
5 | 1 | **6** |  6  |  7
6 | 3 |   6   |  3  | 10
7 | 1 |   7   |  7  | 12

### Pro and cons

Pros:
 - Fast start with early 3 CP unlock.
 - Good Energy generation gives more flexibility in Power card selection and robustness to Events. 
     - Excess Energy can always be converted in an extra Power gain.
 - Can play 3 cards from turn 2 and 4 from turn 8 while still playing a Major.
 - Revealing {{a}} and {{n}} on your tracks helps consistently unlocking Innates.

Cons:
- 4 CP is only unlocked on turn 8, making hitting high level of Innates hard or impossibile,  especially the right one.
