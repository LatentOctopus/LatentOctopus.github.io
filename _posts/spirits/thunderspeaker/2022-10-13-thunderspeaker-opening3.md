## Opening

### Growth

#### Turn 1

(((2-0)))

G2 top. 

Play [[Sudden ambush]] or [[Voice of thunder]].

#### Turn 2

(((4-0)))

G2 top.

Play [[Words of Warning]].

#### Turn 3

(((4-1)))

G3 bottom.

Play [[Voice of thunder]]/[[Sudden ambush]] and [[Manifestation]].

#### Turn 4

(((4-1)))

Reclaim, gain 2 Minors.

Play 2.

#### Turn 5

(((4-3)))

G2 bottom.

Play 3.

#### Turn 6

(((4-3)))

Reclaim, gain 2 Minors.

Play 3.

#### Turn 7

(((4-4)))

G3 bottom.

Play 3.

#### Turn 8

(((4-6)))

G2 bottom.

Play 4.


#### Remarks

On either or both Reclaim turns (turn 4 and 6), you can gain one Major (do _not_ gain a second Major, even if the first one is bad, in order not to give up a card play later on). It's recommended to gain the Major first, then gaining a Minor keeping the Major's threshold in mind (if feasible). It's best to forget [[Sudden Ambush]], as it's of limited use against England, doesn't have {{s}}, and costs too much to be used alongside [[Manifestation]] and a Major.

On turn 8 G3 top can be selected if needing Energy, delaying 4 CP to turn 10.

The 3rd Energy can be unlocked on turn 3 by selecting G2 top+bottom. This will give less energy on turn 3, 4, 5, even out on turn 6, and give more Energy from turn 7 onwards. This is generally less effective, as Energy in the mid game is usually a bigger problem than in the late game.

### Stats


Turn | Growth | Owned cards | Cards in hand | CE | Ele+CP
:--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--:
1 | 2 |   4   |  4  |  2 | {{a}}1
2 | 2 |   4   |  3  |  4 | {{a}}{{f}}{{s}}1
3 | 3 |   4   |  2  | 10 | {{a}}{{f}}{{s}}2
4 | 1 |   6   |  6  | 12 | {{a}}{{f}}{{s}}2
5 | 2 |   6   |  4  | 14 | {{a}}{{f}}{{s}}3
6 | 1 |   8   |  8  | 16 | {{a}}{{f}}{{s}}3
7 | 3 |   8   |  6  | 22 | {{a}}{{f}}{{s}}3
8 | 2 |   8   |  4  | 24 | {{a}}{{f}}{{s}}4


### Pro and cons

Pros:
- Good Energy while still placing double presence often.
- Unlock right Innate from turn 2 onwards.
- 4 {{a}} unlock on turn 5.
- 4 {{s}} unlock on turn 5.

Cons:
- Very weak turn 1 and fairly weak turn 2.
- Very late Reclaim 1 unlock.
- 3 CP only from turn 5 (which is average), but no option to unlock before that.





## Variant: Early 3CP (Minors/Mixed)

This variant trades getting to 3 CP earlier for fewer unlocks of [[Lead the furious assault]] (skipping in on turn 2 and possibly turn 3 as well).

#### Turn 1

(((2-0)))

G2 top. 

Play [[Sudden ambush]] or [[Voice of thunder]].

#### Turn 2

(((2-1)))

G3 bottom.

Play [[Words of Warning]].

#### Turn 3

(((2-3)))

G2 bottom.

Play [[Manifestation]] and [[Voice of thunder]] / [[Sudden ambush]].

#### Turn 4

(((2-3)))

Reclaim, gain 2 Minors.

Play 3.

#### Turn 5

(((4-3)))

G2 top.

Play 3.

#### Turn 6+

Same as above.

#### Remarks

Reclaim 1 can be unlocked on turn 5, if you want to unlock 4 CP on turn 7. This is usually not worth delaying 4 {{s}} until turn 7 (instead of turn 5), but it's sometimes useful.
