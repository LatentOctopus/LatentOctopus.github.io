#### Remarks

On either or both Reclaim turns (turn 4 and 6), you can gain one Major (do _not_ gain a second Major, even if the first one is bad, in order not to give up a card play later on). It's recommended to gain the Major first, then gaining a Minor keeping the Major's threshold in mind (if feasible). It's best to forget [[Sudden Ambush]], as it's of limited use against England, doesn't have Sun, and costs too much to be used alongside [[Manifestation]] and a Major.

On turn 8 G3 top can be selected if needing Energy, delaying 4 CP to turn 10.

The 3rd Energy can be unlocked on turn 3 by selecting G2 top+bottom. This will give less energy on turn 3, 4, 5, even out on turn 6, and give more Energy from turn 7 onwards. This is generally less effective, as Energy in the mid game is usually a bigger problem than in the late game.
