### Pro and cons

Pros:
- Highest CP while still having the Energy to play all the Uniques.
- Unlocks Reclaim 1 on turn 4.

Cons:
- Dependant on G3 for Energy, thus being limited in presence placement for both number and range.
- No elements on presence track makes it harder to activate your Innates.
- 4 Air and 4 Sun power spikes come very late in the game.
