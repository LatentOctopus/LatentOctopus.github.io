## Opening

### Growth

#### Turn 1

(((0-1)))

G3 bottom. 

Play 2. 
- [[Sudden ambush]] and [[Manifestation]] is often good against BP as you'll still have a target for next turn's [[Words of warning]].
- [[Manifestation]] and [[Voice of thunder]] is another option if [[Sudden ambush]] doesn't solve a land, and will unlock level 2 of [[Lead the furious assault]]. 
- [[Voice of thunder]] and [[Sudden ambush]] is generally worse, but it is an option if there is no good target for [[Manifestation]] due to awkward Dahan starting locations, and allows to unlock level 2 of the right Innate in the next turn.

#### Turn 2

(((2-1)))

G2 top.

Play [[Words of Warning]] and the remaining card.

#### Turn 3

(((2-1)))

Reclaim, gain 2 Minors.

Play 2.

#### Turn 4

(((2-2)))

G3 bottom.

Play 2.

#### Turn 5

(((2-4)))

G2 bottom.

Play 3.

#### Turn 6

(((2-4)))

Reclaim, gain 2 Minors.

Play 3.

#### Turn 7

(((4-4)))

G2 top.

Play 3.

#### Remarks

3 CP could be unlocked on turn 4 by swapping turn 4's and turn 5's growth, postponing the Energy gain and only playing 2 cards on turn 5.
