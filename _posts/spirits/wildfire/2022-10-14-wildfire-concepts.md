## Growth

Wildfire needs both Energy and cards to play: 
Energy because it has an awful Energy track 
but fairly costly Uniques 
(cost 4-1=3, since [[Flame's fury]] gives 1);
 cards because its Reclaim turns are extremely
 weak. Thus, G3 needs to be used in between
 Reclaim turns, and G2 should be used a
 few times, especially early. When to use 
one or the other depends on the game state 
and the range of presence placement needed.


## Reclaim

Since Reclaim turns are a lot more passive, 
they need to be delayed as much as possible 
by using G2 whenever feasible (but keeping
 in mind that G3 needs to be taken 
occasionally), and by being very mindful 
of card economy, i.e. not playing cards 
if they are not needed.

This is less important when going the Majors 
route since reclaiming allows to replay 
the Major, but should still be kept in mind.

For the same reason, if the situation is 
under control this turn it might be worth
 reclaiming even with cards still left 
to play, in order to be able to place
 presence in the following turns.

## Presence tracks

Wildfire's top track is terrible. Rushing 1 
Energy means delaying 2 CP to turn 4 and 
3 CP to at least turn 6, which is too slow, 
while the advantage is negligible: the 
cumulative Energy gain at turn 5 due to 
unlocking 1 Energy on turn 2 is +4 Energy, 
which corresponds to a single G3. 

Wildfire can afford to play low- or mid-cost
Majors using G3 and [[Flame's fury]] alone, 
without the need to rush 1 Energy.

## Power drafting 

For Minors, prioritise 
Fire+Plant > Plant > Fire/other. Plant only 
is better than Fire only because getting 
to 3 Plant doubles the effectiveness of 
all Fire you have. For example, assuming 
2 Fire from presence tracks are unlocked, 
3Fire-1Plant (e.g. Fire+Plant, Fire, 
Fire powers) gives 2 damage for [[Firestorm]], 
while 1-3 gives 3 damage; 3-2 still gives 
2 damage, 2-3 gives 4.

## Presence placement

It's hard to access blighted lands once 
2 Fire are unlocked, as you'll either 
have to take away the blight (requires 
good Minor RNG) or cascade. Thus, 
it's worth considering placing one 
of the first presence in the 
already-blighted land, or creating a sacred 
site in a land that's about to Ravage.

## Opening flexibility 

Since placing presence is effectively one 
of Wildfire's actions, the sequence of card 
plays and Reclaim turns is much more 
impactful and subject to variation than 
with most other Spirits. It's hard to 
capture this flexibility in an opening,
but keep in mind that other choices 
may be valid depending on the game 
state and Power draws (this is generally
true, but even more so for Wildfire).
