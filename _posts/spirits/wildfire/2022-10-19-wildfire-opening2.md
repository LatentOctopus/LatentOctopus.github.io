The idea of this opening is to replace the over-costed 
[[Flash-fires]] as soon as possible with a Major, and relying on
the energy from G3 to be able to play it. Early Majors are often a 
gamble, but they can give Wildfire a (slim) fighting chance against
damage-resilient adversaries, most notably England.
