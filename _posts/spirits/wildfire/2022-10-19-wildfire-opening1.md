## Notes

As I mentioned in {% post_url 2022-10-14-wildfire-concepts %}, Wildfire's openings are very situational and harder to plan than most Spirit's. Some suggestions are provided below, but you will have to go off the beaten path more often than usual.

## Bottom track (Minors/Mixed)

### Growth

#### Turn 1

![](/assets/images/Wildfire0-1.png)

G3 bottom. 

Play [[Asphyxiating smoke]].

#### Turn 2

![](/assets/images/Wildfire1-1.png)

G2 top, gain Minor.

Play [[Threatening flames]].

#### Turn 3

![](/assets/images/Wildfire1-2.png)

G3 bottom.

Play [[Flame's fury]] and [[Flash fires]]/Minor.

#### Turn 4

![](/assets/images/Wildfire1-2.png)

Reclaim, gain Minor, or Major forgetting [[Flash fires]].

Play 2.

#### Turn 5

![](/assets/images/Wildfire1-3.png)

G3 bottom.


#### Remarks

Turn 1 and 2 plays can be changed to [[Flame's fury]]/[[Threatening flames]] > [[Asphyxiating smoke]] to either destroy a Town in turn 1 fast instead of slow (if playing [[Flame's fury]]) or to empty an Explorer+Town land in fast by killing the Explorer and pushing the Town (if playing [[Threatening flames]]).


### Stats

Turn | Growth | Owned cards | Cards in hand | CE | Fire and CP
:--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--:
1 | 3 |   4   |  4  |  3 | {{f}}1
2 | 2 |   5   |  4  |  3 | {{f}}{{f}}1
3 | 3 |   5   |  3  |  7 | {{f}}{{f}}2
4 | 1 |6/**5**| 6/5 |  8 | {{f}}{{f}}2
5 | 3 |  6/5  |  ?  | 12 | {{f}}{{f}}3


### Pro and cons

Pros:
- Early 2{{f}} unlock.
- Doing 2 damage on presence placement can free up card plays, opening the possibility to delay the reclaim turn.

Cons:
- Late 3 CP.
- Lots of blight early on, likely flipping the card.



## Variant: Flash Fire (Minors/Mixed)

### Growth

#### Turn 1

![](/assets/images/Wildfire0-1.png)

G2 bottom, gain Minor. 

Play [[Flame's fury]] to deal overall 3 damage between Special Rule and [[Firestorm]].

#### Turn 2

![](/assets/images/Wildfire0-2.png)

G3 bottom.

Play [[Asphyxiating smoke]] and [[Flash fires]].

#### Turn 3

![](/assets/images/Wildfire0-3.png)

G2 bottom.

Play [[Threatening flames]] and up to 2 Minors.

#### Turn 4

![](/assets/images/Wildfire0-3.png)

Reclaim, gain Minor, or Major forgetting [[Flash fires]].

#### Turn 5

![](/assets/images/Wildfire0-4.png)

G3 bottom.


#### Remarks

If you plan to spend more Energy on turn 4 and/or getting a Major, you can take G3 on turn 3 instead.

Presence can be taken from the top track on turn 3 if needed, although it's generally a worse choice than unlocking the 3rd CP unless costly/unaffordable Minors have been gained, as it will make the reclaim turn even weaker by having one fewer CP and no possibility to reach 3{{p}}.


### Stats

Turn | Growth | Owned cards | Cards in hand | CE | Fire and CP
:--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--:
1 | 2 |   5   |  5  |  0 | {{f}}1
2 | 3 |   5   |  4  |  4 | {{f}}2
3 | 2 |   6   |  3  |  4 | {{f}}3
4 | 1 |7/**6**| 7/6 |  5 | {{f}}3
5 | 3 |  7/6  |  ?  |  9 | {{f}}{{f}}3


### Pro and cons

Pros:
- Lots of fast damage on turn 1 and 2.
- Turn 1 G2 gives more range for presence placement in the early game.
- Earliest 3 CP.
- Low on blight.

Cons:
- Late 2{{f}} unlock.
- Low on blight means fewer targets for [[Firestorm]]


## Early Major (Majors)

### Growth

#### Turn 1

![](/assets/images/Wildfire0-1.png)

G2 bottom, gain Major, forget [[Flash fires]]. 

Play [[Threatening flames]].

#### Turn 2

![](/assets/images/Wildfire1-1.png)

G3 top.

Play the Major or [[Asphyxiating smoke]].

#### Turn 3

![](/assets/images/Wildfire1-2.png)

G2 bottom, gain Minor or replace Major.

Play [[Flame's fury]] and possibly the remaining Power.

#### Turn 4

![](/assets/images/Wildfire1-2.png)

Reclaim, gain Minor.

Play 2.

#### Turn 5

![](/assets/images/Wildfire1-3.png)

G3 bottom.

Play 2.

#### Remarks

G3 can be used in turn 3 if playing the Major in turn 2/3 and planning on playing it in turn 4.


### Stats

Turn | Growth | Owned cards | Cards in hand | CE | Fire and CP
:--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--:
1 | 2 | **4** |  4  |  0 | {{f}}1
2 | 3 |   4   |  3  |  4 | {{f}}{{f}}1
3 | 2 |5/**4**|  2  |  4 | {{f}}{{f}}2
4 | 1 |  6/5  | 6/5 |  5 | {{f}}{{f}}2
5 | 3 |  6/5  | 4/3 |  9 | {{f}}{{f}}3


### Pro and cons

Mostly same as the bottom track opening above. Majors are a gamble as usual, but [[Flash fires]] is very overcosted and replacing it early on gives time to plan around the Major.
