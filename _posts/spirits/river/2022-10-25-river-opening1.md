## Full bottom track (Minors | Base, Travel)

**Similar to [RedReVenge](https://youtube.com/channel/UCdVLtmFObyfW9-ADPXaSrSg)'s guide.**


This is the standard opening for River. It exploits River's strong, perfect-element Uniques to reliably unlock level 3 [[Massive flooding]] from the 4th turn on.

### Growth

#### Turn 1

![](/assets/images/River0-2.png)

G2 bottom. 

Play [[River's bounty]] and another card. 1{{s}}2{{w}} elements (you could have 2{{s}}, but it doesn't matter as you can't unlock level 2 of your Innate anyway).

#### Turn 2

![](/assets/images/River0-4.png)

G2 bottom. Reclaim [[River's bounty]].

Play 3. 2{{s}}3{{w}} elements.

#### Turn 3

![](/assets/images/River0-4.png)

Reclaim, gain Minor.

Play [[River's bounty]] and the Minor. The Minor can be swapped as long as you keep 2{{s}}3{{w}}1{{e}} in hand.

#### Turn 4

![](/assets/images/River0-6.png)

G2 bottom. Reclaim [[River's bounty]].

Play [[River's bounty]] and 3 more to have 3{{s}}4{{w}}1{{e}} and unlock a max-level [[Massive flooding]]. 

#### Turn 5+

Reclaim loop, gaining Minors every turn and playing the cards you need to unlock your Innate.

If at any point you don't need to reclaim (this usually happens somewhere around turn 7-9), take a G3 top and gain a Major (forgetting [[Flash floods]] is usually the best option if you have gained other cards with good elements, as it is too expensive for what it does), then keep reclaim looping.

#### Remarks

You might be tempted to reclaim something else than [[River's bounty]], but that is a mistake most of the time. [[River's bounty]] is an excellent card (which is even better if you're playing Travel River), plus you need the Energy. One exception is in multiplayer if you receive any kind of Energy support, in which case you can consider reclaiming [[Boon of vigor]] to give back tons of Energy instead.

On turn 5 an alternative is taking presence top+bottom to get to 2-4 instead of 1-5. This is generally a bad idea: you need to play your full starting hand for max-level [[Massive flooding]], and having only 4 CP means you have no room to play anything else. If you have had luck with your draws you might have found another {{s}}+{{w}} to replace [[Flash floods]], but even then you're still restricted in what cards you can play, and you'll accumulate a lot of Energy that you can't use. The only time you should consider going 2-4 is if you want to go for Majors on turn 6, which will however limit your ability to unlock level 3 of [[Massive flooding]] unless you are lucky with your card draws (you'd either need to find one of the [7 {{s}}+{{w}} Majors with cost <= 4](https://sick.oberien.de/?query=Type%3AMajor%2C%20elements%3ASun%2Cwater%2C%20cost%3A%3C%3D4), or [Cleansing floods](https://sick.oberien.de/?query=Cleansing) if you've found a 0-cost {{w}}+{{e}} Minor to replace [[Wash away]]).

### Stats

Note that the Energy gained from [[Boon of vigor]] is _not_ included, so the table works for multiplayer games as well.

This table assumes playing 5 cards from turn 5 onwards, and forgetting from discard when gaining the Major.

Turn | Growth | Owned cards | Cards in hand | CE (growth only) | CE (also including previous [[River's bounty]])
:--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |  :--: | :--:
1 | 2 |   4   |  4  |  1 |  1
2 | 2 |   4   |  3  |  2 |  3
3 | 1 |   5   |  5  |  4 |  6
4 | 2 |   5   |  4  |  5 |  8
5 | 1 |   6   |  6  |  7 | 11
6 | 1 |   7   |  7  |  9 | 14
7 | 1 |   8   |  8  | 11 | 17
8 | 3 | **8** |  5  | 13 | 20
9 | 1 |   9   |  9  | 16 | 24



### Pro and cons

Pros:
 - Highest CP.
 - Fastest unlock of max [[Massive flooding]].
 - Consistent usage of max [[Massive flooding]] from turn 4 on while still allowing off-elements Minors thanks to 5 CP.

Cons:
- Tight on Energy in multiplayer.
- Little presence placement past turn 4 requires careful planning on first turns.
