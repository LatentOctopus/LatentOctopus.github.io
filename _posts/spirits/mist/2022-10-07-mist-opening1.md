### Growth

#### Turn 1

![](/assets/images/Mist1-1.png)

G2 top+bottom. 

Play [[Fog closes in]] + [[Forms dart by]]. 2-2-2 Moon-Air-Water elements (left and right Innate level 1).

Try to have 2 lands with damaged Invaders by the end of the turn.


#### Turn 2

![](/assets/images/Mist1-2.png)

G3 bottom, gain Minor. 

Play [[Unnerving pall]] and possibly a 0-cost Minor. 1-1-0 elements (no Innate).

If possible, use the Dahan counterattack to have a 3rd land with a damaged Invader in order to get 1 Energy via your special rule (and farm extra fear).


#### Turn 3

![](/assets/images/Mist1-4.png)

G2 bottom. 

Play [[Dissolving vapors]] and possibly a 0-cost Minor (if not played previously). 2-1-1 elements (no Innate).Â 


#### Turn 4

![](/assets/images/Mist1-4.png)

Reclaim, gain Minor. 

Play 3.

#### Turn 5

![](/assets/images/Mist1-6.png)

G2 bottom. 

Play 4.

#### Turn 6

![](/assets/images/Mist1-6.png)

Reclaim, gain Minor.

Play 4.


#### Remarks

On turn 6, Presence can be taken from the top track to get to 2/3 instead of 1/4+R1. This is not normally required if a 0-cost has been found, but it may be needed in case of bad luck with draws, Events or other factors.

If you have not gained an extra energy by turn 3 via either of your Special Rules, you can't afford to play [[Dissolving vapors]], so you need to Reclaim. The growth will then be shifted by 1 turn, looking like this:

1.  Same
2.  Same
3.  Reclaim, gain Minor. Play 2.   
4.  G2 bottom. Play 3.  
5.  Reclaim, gain Minor. Play 3. 
6.  G2 bottom. Play 4.  
7.  Reclaim.
