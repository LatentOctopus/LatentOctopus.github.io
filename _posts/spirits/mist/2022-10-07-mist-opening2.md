## Opening

**Adapted from [Rei's guide on BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2722115/advanced-guide-shroud-silent-mist).**

The idea is to take a weaker early game (namely turn 2 and 3) to scale faster into the mid game.


### Growth

#### Turn 1

(((1-1)))

G2 top+bottom. 

Play [[The fog closes in]] + [[Forms dart by]]. 2{{m}}2{{a}}2{{w}} elements (left and right Innate level 1).

Try to have 2 lands with damaged Invaders by the end of the turn.


#### Turn 2

(((1-2)))

G3 bottom, gain Minor. 

Play [[Unnerving pall]] and possibly a 0-cost Minor. 1{{m}}1{{a}} elements (no Innate).

If possible, use the Dahan counterattack to have a 3rd land with a damaged Invader in order to get 1 Energy via your special rule (and farm extra fear).


#### Turn 3

(((1-4)))

G2 bottom. 

Play [[Dissolving vapors]] and possibly a 0-cost Minor (if not played previously). 2{{m}}1{{a}}1{{w}} elements (no Innate).Â 


#### Turn 4

(((1-4)))

Reclaim, gain Minor. 

Play 3.

#### Turn 5

(((1-6)))

G2 bottom. 

Play 4.

#### Turn 6

(((1-6)))

Reclaim, gain Minor.

Play 4.


#### Remarks

On turn 5, Presence can be taken from the top track to get to 2/3 instead of 1/4+R1. This is not normally required if a 0-cost has been found, but it may be needed in case of bad luck with draws, Events or other factors.

If you have not gained an extra energy by turn 3 via either of your Special Rules, you can't afford to play [[Dissolving vapors]], so you need to Reclaim. The growth will then be shifted by 1 turn, looking like this:

1.  Same
2.  Same
3.  Reclaim, gain Minor. Play 2.   
4.  G2 bottom. Play 3.  
5.  Reclaim, gain Minor. Play 3. 
6.  G2 bottom. Play 4.  
7.  Reclaim.


### Stats


The 3 columns for CE represent

1. The Energy from the Energy track only.
2. The above + the Energy from gaining a Power without {{f}} (which is quite a reliable Energy source).
3. The above + the Energy gained from having 3 lands with damaged Invaders (this can be unreliable at times).

Turn | Growth | Owned cards | Cards in hand | CE (E/turn only) | CE (+card) | CE (+ card and 3 lands)
:--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--:
1 | 2 |   4   | 4 | 1 |  1 |  1
2 | 3 |   5   | 3 | 2 |  3 |  3
3 | 2 |   5   | 2 | 3 |  4 |  5
4 | 1 |   6   | 6 | 4 |  6 |  8
5 | 2 |   6   | 4 | 5 |  7 | 10
6 | 1 |   7   | 7 | 6 |  9 | 13

### Pro and cons

Pros:

- Strong turn 1.
- Fast growth, reaching 1/3 by turn 3 (although only using 3 CP from turn 4).
	- Strong turn 4+.

Cons:

- Weak turn 2 and fairly weak turn 3.
- May need quick adaptations if draws are bad or Energy is not gained or is lost for any reason.
