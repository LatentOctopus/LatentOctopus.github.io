## Opening


### Growth

#### Turn 1

(((1-1)))

G2 top+bottom. 

Play [[The fog closes in]] + [[Forms dart by]]. 2{{m}}2{{a}}2{{w}} elements (left and right Innate level 1).

Try to have 2 lands with damaged Invaders by the end of the turn.


#### Turn 2

(((1-1)))

Reclaim, gain Minor. 

Play to get at least 1{{m}}2{{a}}1{{w}} elements and unlock left Innate level 1 (e.g. [[Unnerving pall]] + [[Forms dart by]]).

Try to use the Dahan counterattack and/or your Innate to have a 3rd land with a damaged Invader in order to get 1 Energy via your special rule (and farm extra fear).


#### Turn 3

(((1-2)))

G3 bottom, gain Minor. 

Play 2.


#### Turn 4

(((1-4)))

G2 bottom. 

Play 2.

#### Turn 5

(((1-4)))

Reclaim, gain Minor. 

Play 3.

#### Turn 6

(((1-6)))

G2 bottom.

Play 4.


#### Remarks

If you can afford playing only 1 card on turn 3, you can play 3 on turn 4 and possibly unlock the second level of your left Innate. However, it is usually not worth sacrificing turn 3 to do so if the board is not in an especially forgiving state.

You should aim at having 3 lands with damaged Invaders and the end of turn 2 or at least turn 3, both for the Energy itself and for the extra Fear. If you haven't, and you also have gained 2 1-cost Minors on turn 2 and 3, you need to Reclaim on turn 4. The growth will then look like this:

1. Same.
2. Same.
3. Same.   
4. Reclaim, gain Minor. Play 2. 
5. G2 bottom. Play 3.
6. Reclaim, gain Minor. Play 3.
7. G2 bottom. Play 4.


### Stats

The 3 columns for CE represent

1. The Energy from the Energy track only.
2. The above + the Energy from gaining a Power without {{f}} (which is quite a reliable Energy source).
3. The above + the Energy gained from having 3 lands with damaged Invaders (this can be unreliable at times).

Turn | Growth | Owned cards | Cards in hand | CE (E/turn only) | CE (+card) | CE (+ card and 3 lands)
:--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--:
1 | 2 |   4   | 4 | 1 |  1 |  1
2 | 1 |   5   | 5 | 2 |  3 |  3
3 | 3 |   6   | 4 | 3 |  5 |  6
4 | 2 |   6   | 2 | 4 |  6 |  8
5 | 1 |   7   | 7 | 5 |  8 | 11
6 | 2 |   7   | 4 | 6 |  9 | 13

### Pro and cons

Pros:

- Strong turn 1.
- Stable early game, playing 2 cards every turn.
- Strong turn 5+.

Cons:

- Slow-ish scaling, since 3 CP can generally only be played on turn 5.
