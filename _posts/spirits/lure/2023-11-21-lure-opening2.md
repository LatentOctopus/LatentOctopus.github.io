## Opening

General idea: gain an early Major and alternate playing it with playing [[Softly beckon ever inward]] every reclaim cycle.

### Growth

#### Turn 1

(((0-1)))

G2 bottom; G3 {{p}}. 

Play [[Gift of the untamed wild]] and [[Perils of the deepest island]]. Unlock left innate level 2 and right Innate level 1+2.
    
#### Turn 2

(((1-1)))

G2 top; G4 Major, prioritise cost <= 4 and with at least one of {{m}} or {{p}}, forget from discard ([[Perils of the deepest island]] is recommended if cost > 3).

Play [[Softly beckon ever inward]] and [[Swallowed by the wilderness]].

Optionally, if the Major is good and costs 2 or 3, it can be played instead of [[Softly beckon ever inward]].

#### Turn 3

(((1-1)))

 Reclaim; G4 Major if needing to replace, otherwise Minor to threshold. 
 
 Play Major and [[Gift of the untamed wild]].

#### Turn 4

(((1-2)))

 G2 bottom; G3 {{m}}/{{p}}.
    
Play [[Softly beckon ever inward]] and [[Swallowed by the wilderness]]. Unlock left or right innate level 2.
    
#### Turn 5

(((1-2)))

 Reclaim; G3.
 
 Play 2 so as to keep cards to threshold the Major next turn, if possible. [[Softly beckon ever inward]] and  [[Gift of the untamed wild]] is a good option, unlocking left innate level 3 if picked {{m}} with G3.

#### Turn 6

(((1-3)))

G2 bottom; G4 Minor if < 5 owned cards, else G3.

Play Major and 2 more.

#### Turn 7

(((1-3)))
    
 Reclaim; G4 Minor. 
 
 Play 3.

#### Turn 8 onwards

(((2-3)))

G2 top; G3. 
 
Play 3.

Keep selecting G1+G3 if needing to reclaim, otherwise G2+G3 taking presence from top.


### Stats

Turn | Growths | Owned cards | Cards in hand | CE
:--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--:
1 | 2, 3   |   4   |  4  | 3
2 | 2, 4   | **4** |  3  | 5
3 | 1, 4   |5/**4**| 5/4 | 8
4 | 2, 3   |  5/4  | 3/2 | 12
5 | 1, 3   |  5/4  | 5/4 | 17
6 | 2, 4/3 |   5   |  3  | 19/21
7 | 1, 4   |   6   |  6  | 22/24
8 | 2, 3   |   6   |  3  | 26/28



### Pro and cons

Pros:

- Able to play low-cost Majors while still reaching 3 CP
- Able to threshold even off-element Majors with some luck from Minor draws thanks to 3 CP
- Still capable of occasionally activating level 3 of left innate.

Cons:

- Cannot play high-cost Majors, thus having a hard time if getting draws with many costly cards
- Forced to forget one of Lure's uniques early
- Not a lot of room for Energy losses, especially if needing to redraw the Major.









## Variant: (Full) top track

This has the same 3 turns as the previous opening, but keeps taking presence from the top track after that. It is best suited when one or more of the following applies:

1. You don't care about hitting the Major's threshold, or you can do it at 2 CP.
2. You want to play the Major and [[Softly beckon ever inward]] every turn.
3. You want to play multiple Majors, perhaps even in the same turn if affordable.

### Growth

#### Turn 1, 2 and 3

(((1-1)))

Same as above, but take G3 on turn 3 if not replacing Major.

#### Turn 4

(((2-1)))

 G2 top; G3 {{m}}.
    
Play [[Softly beckon ever inward]] and [[Swallowed by the wilderness]]. Unlock left innate level 3.
    
#### Turn 5

(((2-1)))

 Reclaim; G3.
 
 Play 2, preferably include [[Gift of the untamed wild]].

#### Turn 6

(((3-1)))

G2 top; G4 for second Major (forgetting [[Gift of the untamed wild]]).

Play 2.

#### Turn 7

(((3-1)))
    
 Reclaim; G4 if previous Major is bad and DID NOT redraw on turn 3, else G3. 
 
 Play 2.

#### Turn 8 onwards

G3 + either G1 if needed, or G2 taking presence from the top track.

7 | 1, 3/4 |4/**4**|  4  | 28/26


### Pro and cons

Pros:

- Sees many Majors, reducing impact of bad draws.
- Able to play multiple Majors
	- In the late game can even on the same turn, or alternate high-cost and mid-cost across two turns.
- Still capable of occasionally activating level 3 of left innate.
- If not needing to redraw Majors, has Energy to spare for Events.

Cons:

- Stuck at 2 CP for the whole game
- Forced to forget uniques due to lack of Minor gains
