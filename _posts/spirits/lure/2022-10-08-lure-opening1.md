## Opening

General idea: use G3 for Elements and Energy, while placing presence from bottom track to gain CP. 

### Growth

#### Turn 1

(((0-1)))

G2 bottom; G4 Minor, prioritise {{m}}{{a}}({{p}}) > {{m}} > rest. 

Play [[Gift of the untamed wild]] and [[Perils of the deepest island]]. Unlock left innate level 2. And right Innate level 2.
    
#### Turn 2

(((0-2)))

G2 bottom; G3 {{m}}.

Play [[Softly beckon ever inward]] and [[Swallowed by the wilderness]]. Unlock left innate level 2.

#### Turn 3

(((0-2)))

 Reclaim; G3 {{m}} if needing to deal with City, otherwise G4 Minor. 
 
 Play 2.

#### Turn 4

(((0-3)))

 G2 bottom;Â G3 {{m}}/{{p}} or G4 Minor, the _opposite_ of what selected in the previous turn.
    
Play 3.
    
#### Turn 5

(((0-3)))

 Reclaim; G4 Minor.
 
 Play 3.

#### Turn 6

(((0-4)))

G2 bottom; G3.

Play 4.

#### Turn 7

(((0-4)))
    
 Reclaim; G3. 
 
 Play 3 or 4.

#### Turn 8

(((0-5)))

 G2 bottom to unlock reclaim 1; G3. 
 
 Play 4 or 5.

#### Turn 9 onwards

(((0-5)))

Reclaim; G3.

Play 5.


#### Remarks

It's a good idea to use 1 G3 and 1 G4 for every reclaim cycle (2 turns) to be able to pay for the cards while gaining new Powers to sustain the next reclaim cycle (which will be at +1 card plays).

Optionally, 2 Energy can be unlocked on turn 2, but this slows everything down by 2 turns.

### Pro and cons

Pros:

- High card plays (for Lure's standards at least) to make use of Lure's good Uniques
	- Paired with G3, this allows activating Lure's strong innates early and often.

Cons:

- Reliance on G3 means not too many chances of gaining new cards (only 3 throughout the game)
- Even with G3, Energy is tight. Playing 1-cost Minors will often require not playing one of your 1- or 2-cost Uniques, so it's generally recommended to pick 0-cost.
