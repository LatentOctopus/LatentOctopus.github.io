## 2-CP-start hybrid (Mixed)

### Growth

#### Turn 1

(((0-1)))

G3 bottom, gain Minor. If you gained a 1-cost, make sure to keep [[Grasping roots]], or you won't be able to play to max CP. [[Blazing intimidation]] is usually the best option to discard.

Play 2 with 2{{f}}{{e}} to unlock [[Smash, stomp, and flatten]]. It's recommended to play [[Surging lahar]] if possible, as having Badlands down early helps a lot with damage.

#### Turn 2

(((2-1)))

G2 top. 

Play 2. Depending on your draws and plays, you might be able to unlock the second level of your innate, but you should always be able to unlock the first level.

#### Turn 3

(((2-1)))

G4, reclaiming and empowering your Incarna. 

Play 2.

#### Turn 4

(((2-3)))

G2 bottom to 3 CP.

Play 3.

#### Turn 5

(((2-3)))

Reclaim, gain Minor.

Play 3.

#### Turn 6

(((3-3)))

G3 top, discard BEFORE gaining, then gain Major and forget from discard.

Play 3.

### Remarks

If keeping [[Blazing intimidation]] on turn 1, energy might be tight later on, and you might need to swap turn 4 and turn 6 to unlock 3 Energy/turn on turn 4 and 3 CP on turn 6.
