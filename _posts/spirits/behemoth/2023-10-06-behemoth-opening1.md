## 2-CP-start hybrid (Mixed)

### Growth

#### Turn 1

(((0-1)))

G3 bottom, gain Minor. If you gained a 1-cost, make sure to keep [[Grasping roots]] in hand, or you won't be able to play to max CP.

Play 2 with 2{{f}}1{{e}} to unlock [[Smash, stomp, and flatten]]. If you only consider your Uniques, since [[Terrifying rampage]] is useless on turn 1 and you don't have 4 Energy, you have two options:

1. [[Surging lahar]] and [[Grasping roots]]
2. [[Blazing intimidation]] and [[Grasping roots]]

Option 1, if you have good targets for [[Surging lahar]], is generally superior, as having Badlands down early helps a lot with damage in later turns.

If the Minor you gained has {{f}}, it can replace any of the above. If you keep a {{f}}{{p}} in hand, such as [[Grasping roots]], you will be able to unlock level 2 of your Innate next turn.

#### Turn 2

(((2-1)))

G2 top. 

Play 2. Depending on your draws and plays, you might be able to unlock the second level of your Innate, but you should always be able to unlock the first level.

#### Turn 3

(((2-1)))

G4, reclaiming and empowering your Incarna. 

Play 2.

#### Turn 4

(((2-3)))

G2 bottom to 3 CP.

Play 2 or 3 (if you have not found a card with {{f}}, you won't have 3 cards to play, but it's still worth getting to 3 CP to play 3 cards next turn.

#### Turn 5

(((2-3)))

Reclaim, gain Minor.

Play 3.

#### Turn 6

(((3-3)))

G3 top gain Major and forget from discard. If you are planning on forgetting a card with {{f}} from your hand, discard that card BEFORE gaining the Major.

Play 3.

### Remarks

If keeping [[Blazing intimidation]] on turn 1, energy might be tight later on, and you might need to swap turn 4 and turn 6 to unlock 3 Energy/turn on turn 4 and 3 CP on turn 6.
