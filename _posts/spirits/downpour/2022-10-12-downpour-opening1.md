## Bottom track (Minors)

The idea is to unlock 2 CP as soon as possible and then going top track while taking frequent G2s to have as much Energy and Water as possible to repeat your Powers.

#### Turn 10 onwards

Take G1 if needing to reclaim, G2 otherwise (even after you empty your tracks).

#### Remarks

A Major can be gained earlier on (turn 5 or 6), but usually the Energy is better spent repeating Uniques or Minors.

2 CP coupled with your Innates are usually enough to deal with a variety of issues. If 3 CP are really needed, they can be unlocked on turn 6 or even as soon as turn 4, but not unlocking the Plant element will likely hurt Energy generation.

### Stats

Note that the Energy gains from [[Gift of abundance]] and the right Innate are _not_ taken into account.

### Pro and cons

Pros:
 - High CP while still gaining a lot of Water and Energy.
 - Strong at all points of the game.

Cons:
- Doesn't go through the top track as fast as other openings.
- Cannot consistently repeat Majors until very late.
