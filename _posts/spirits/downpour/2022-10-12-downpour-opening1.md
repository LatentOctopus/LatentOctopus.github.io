## Bottom track hybrid (Minors)

The idea is to unlock 2 CP as soon as possible and then going top track while taking frequent G2s to have as much Energy and {{w}} as possible to repeat your Powers.

### Growth

#### Turn 1

G3 bottom, gain Minor. 

Play 1. [[Gift of abundance]] is a good default to scale better.

#### Turn 2

G2 bottom.

Play 2.

#### Turn 3

![](/assets/images/Downpour0-3.png)

Reclaim, gain Minor.

Play 2.

#### Turn 4

![](/assets/images/Downpour2-3.png)

G2 top.

Play 2.

#### Turn 5

Reclaim, gain Minor.

Play 2.

#### Turn 6

![](/assets/images/Downpour3-3.png)

G3 top, gain Minor.

Play 2.

#### Turn 7

![](/assets/images/Downpour5-3.png)

G2 top.

Play 2.

#### Turn 8

![](/assets/images/Downpour5-3.png)

Reclaim, gain Major.

Play 2.

#### Turn 9

![](/assets/images/Downpour7-3.png)

G2 top.

Play 2.

#### Turn 10 onwards

Take G1 if needing to reclaim, G2 otherwise (even after you empty your tracks).

#### Remarks

A Major can be gained earlier on (turn 5 or 6), but usually the Energy is better spent repeating Uniques or Minors.

2 CP coupled with your Innates are usually enough to deal with a variety of issues. If 3 CP are really needed, they can be unlocked on turn 6 or even as soon as turn 4, but not unlocking the Plant element will likely hurt Energy generation.

### Stats

Note that the Energy gains from [[Gift of abundance]] and the right Innate are _not_ taken into account.

Turn | Growth | Owned cards | Cards in hand | CE (start) | Ele+CP | CE (after max [[Pour down]])

7 | 2 |   8   |  2  | 20 | {{a}}{{p}}6x{{w}}2 | 24
8 | 1 | **8** |  8  | 26 | {{a}}{{p}}4x{{w}}2 | 29
9 | 2 |   8   |  4  | 31 | {{a}}{{e}}{{p}}8x{{w}}2 | 36
10| 1 | **8** |  8  | 38 | {{a}}{{e}}{{p}}6x{{w}}2 | 42



### Pro and cons

Pros:
 - Early 2 CP unlock while still gaining a lot of {{w}} and Energy.
 - Good Presence movement.
 - Strong at all points of the game.

Cons:
- Doesn't go through the top track as fast as other openings (less {{w}} and Energy).
- Cannot consistently repeat Majors until very late.


## Variant: 3CP bottom track hybrid (Minors)

This variant aims at unlocking 3CP before going deep in the top track. It follows the above until turn 5:

1. (same as above) G3 bottom, gain Minor; play 1.
2. (same as above) G2 bottom; play 2.
3. (same as above) Reclaim, gain Minor; play 2.
4. (same as above) G2 top; play 2.
5. (same as above) Reclaim, gain Minor; play 2.
6. G2 bottom to 3CP; play 3.
7. Reclaim, gain Minor; play 3.
8. G2 top to {{a}}; play 3.
9. Reclaim, gain Major; play 3.
10. G2 top; play 3.

### Remarks

The increased CP comes at the cost of lower Energy income, as well as delaying getting a Major to even later stages of the game. This tradeoff is generally not worth it, as mentioned above.

3CP can be unlocked even as soon as turn 4 by emptying the bottom track before going top, but not unlocking the {{p}} on your top track will hurt Energy generation even more, unless one of the gained Minors can provide Energy.
