Use this opening if:

- Consistently using the damage threshold of [[Raging hunt]] is not a priority.
- You want to gain many Powers to find useful effects and compensate for the lack of damage.
- You don't want to use Majors.
- You want to unlock high card plays and reclaim-one as soon as possible.

Consider this opening especially against:

- [Base] England, Sweden, Habsburg Livestock.

## Opening

#### Turn 3

#### Turn 5

(((1-4)))

G2 bottom; G4.

Play 3.

#### Turn 6

(((1-5)))

Reclaim, gain Minor; G2 bottom. 

Play 5.

#### Turn 7 onwards

From turn 7 on, growth is G4 + any other, according to needs (G2 should only be selected if placing presence is necessary, and not for growth).

#### Remarks

Taking presence from the top track can be moved from turn 3 to any turn from 1 to 4, or even skipped altogether if not needed for your Innates. (I've included it here because I've found myself taking a presence from the top track somewhere on turn 2-4 more often than not.)

Even with frequent use of G4, Energy can be tight given the high card plays. It's therefore really important to choose Minors carefully, and only gain 1-cost if very strong (this is generally true, but especially so in this case).

Optionally, on turn 4 and 5 presence can be taken from top until 2 Energy to unlock more Energy/turn (**Bottom track hybrid**), to prepare for a late Major.Â However, this shouldn't be needed in most cases, and it's usually a worse hybrid strategy compared to a top track start due to lower Energy income and fewer chances to find a useful Major.

### Pros and cons

Pros:

-   High card plays: 3 on turn 2, 5 on turn 6.
-   Unlock reclaim 1 early on.
	-   This is very useful to either reclaim [[Too near the jungle]] as a 0-cost {{p}}{{n}} to activate [[Ranging hunt]], or [[Prey on the builders]] against build-heavy adversaries such as England.

Cons:

- Very tight in Energy.
- [[Ranging hunt]] cannot consistently be activated, especially throughout the early and mid game.
- Can lack firepower in case of very bad luck with Minors.
