## Growth 

Fangs' growth is extremely versatile. Consider the following second-growth choices over two turns (the first growth being G2 to place presence):

- G3 > G3, which grants +2 cards and +2 Energy;
- G4 > G1, which grants +1 card, +2 Energy and a reclaim; 
- G3 > G1, which grants +2 cards and a reclaim. 

These options give a mix of Energy, extra cards, and reclaim. When writing an opening, a specific second growth option is recommended, but it could often be swapped for another one according to needs. 

For example, G3 > G3 can be swapped for G4 > G1 if reclaiming cards is more valuable than gaining an extra Power. This can be used to activate [[Ranging hunt]] by playing [[Teeth gleam]] and [[Too near the jungle]] on the first turn if taking the presence from the top track, and still have access to them in the next couple of turns thanks to reclaiming cards; the cost to pay is one Minor gain, which will be detrimental in the long run, thus exchanging long-term benefits for a stronger early game.

## Presence conversion

Presence should be converted as much as possible into Beasts, ideally every turn outside of one or two, as typically only 2-4 presence on the island is needed (4 presence mostly to avoid instant loss by [[Tipping Point]] if you're playing on the digital version).

## Minors selection

If going top track (thus unlocking {{n}} and {{p}}), the only requirement for activating [[Ranging hunt]] every turn from the 2nd onwards is to find 1 {{n}} Minor.

If going full bottom track (getting neither {{n}} nor {{p}} from your presence track), prioritise {{p}}{{n}} > {{p}} > {{n}} > other, to have extra cards that reliably activate [[Ranging hunt]]. After 1 {{p}} and 1 {{n}} Minors have been found, elements cease being as much of a priority.

Blight handling is excellent on Fangs, and it might be worth prioritising it over better Elements.
