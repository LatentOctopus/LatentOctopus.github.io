## Full bottom track (Minors)

### Growth

#### Turn 1

![](/assets/images/Fangs%200-1.png)

G2 bottom; G3 Minor, prioritise {{p}} over {{n}}.

Play 2, keeping 2 {{p}}{{n}} and 1 {{n}} in hand. Might activate [[Ranging hunt]] (movement only).


#### Turn 2

(((0-2)))

G2 bottom to unlock 3 CP; G4.

Play 3. [[Ranging hunt]] damage.


#### Turn 3

![](/assets/images/Fangs%200-3.png)

Reclaim, gain Minor, prioritising {{p}} if not found previously; G2 bottom, unlocking Reclaim 1.

Play 3.


#### Turn 4

![](/assets/images/Fangs%200-4.png)

G2 bottom; G4. Reclaim [[Too near the jungle]] or another 0-cost.

Play 4.

#### Turn 5

![](/assets/images/Fangs%200-5.png)

Reclaim, gain Minor; G2 bottom to unlock 5CP and the second Reclaim 1; G4.

Play 5.

#### Turn 6

![](/assets/images/Fangs%200-5.png)

G3, gain Minor; G4. 

Play 5.

#### Turn 7 onwards

From turn 7 on, growth is G4 + any other, according to needs (G2 should only be selected if placing presence is necessary).

#### Remarks

If a {{p}} but no {{n}} have been found, presence should be taken from the top track on turn 4 in order to unlock [[Ranging hunt]]. This delays 4 and 5 CP by one turn (the growth on turn 6 becomes G2+G4).

Optionally, on turn 4-6 presence can be taken from top until 2 Energy to unlock extra elements and more Energy/turn (**Bottom track hybrid**), to prepare for a late Major.Â However, this shouldn't be needed in most cases.

If you haven't found any 0-cost Minors by turn 5, you need to delay the presence placement (and thus 5 CP), instead
taking G1+G4. In that case, turn 6 will be G2+G3 or G2+G4.

### Stats

Turn | Growths | Owned cards | Cards in hand | CE
:--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: 
1 | 2, 3 |   5   | 5 | 2
2 | 2, 4 |   5   | 3 | 6
3 | 1, 2 |   6   | 6 | 6
4 | 2, 4 |   6   | 4 | 10
5 | 1, 2 |   7   | 7 | 10
6 | 3, 4 |   8   | 5 | 14
7 | 1, 4 |   9   | 7 | 17

### Pros and cons

Pros:

-   High card plays: 3 on turn 2, 5 on turn 5.
-   Unlock reclaim 1 on turn 3.
	-   This is very useful to either reclaim [[Too near the jungle]] as a 0-cost Plant+Animal to activate [[Ranging hunt]], or [[Prey on the builders]] against build-heavy adversaries such as England.

Cons:

- Can be tight in Energy if costly Minors have been gained.
- [[Ranging hunt]] cannot reliably be activated on both turn 3 and 4 unless a {{p}} and a {{n}} Minors have been found (or a single {{p}}{{n}}), or at least a {{p}} if delaying 4 CP by one turn by taking one presence from the top track.
- Although Reclaim 1 is unlocked early, you often need to reclaim [[Too near the jungle]] to unlock [[Ranging hunt]], as other Powers 
are too expensive and/or don't have good enough elements, leaving little to no room for flexibility in the reclaim choice.


## Variant: reclaim-heavy full bottom track (Minors)

The idea is to reclaim your Uniques early to unlock [[Ranging hunt]] every single turn (except maybe turn 4 in case of exceptionally bad luck, i.e. no {{p}} found in 2 draws).

### Growth

1. G2 top; G4. Play [[Too near the jungle]] and [[Teeth gleam]].
2. Reclaim, gain Minor, prioritise {{p}}; G2 bottom. Play [[Too near the jungle]] and either [[Teeth gleam]] or the Minor if it has {{p}}{{n}}.
3. Reclaim, gain Minor, prioritise {{p}} if not found; G2 bottom. Play [[Too near the jungle]] and {{p}}+{{n}}.
4. G2 bottom; G4. Reclaim and play Play [[Too near the jungle]] and and {{p}}+{{n}}.
5. Reclaim, gain Minor; G2 bottom. Play 4.
6. G2 bottom to 5 CP; G4. Play 5.
7. Reclaim, gain Minor; G4. Play 5.

### Stats

Turn | Growths | Owned cards | Cards in hand | CE
:--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: 
1 | 2, 4 |   4   | 4 | 4
2 | 1, 2 |   5   | 5 | 4
3 | 1, 2 |   6   | 6 | 4
4 | 2, 4 |   6   | 4 | 8
5 | 1, 2 |   7   | 7 | 8
6 | 2, 4 |   7   | 5 | 12
7 | 1, 4 |   8   | 8 | 15

### Pros and cons

Pros:

- Strong turn 1.
- Playing [[Teeth gleam]] in all the first 2-3 turns allows to scale better into the mid game, thanks to the higher number of Beasts on the island.

Cons:

- Even more energy-starved than the standard bottom track.
  - On turn 5+ it is impossible to play to max CP if no 0-cost Minors have been found.
  - More susceptible to Events.
- No flexibility in turn 1 card plays, and little to none in turn 2.
