## Full bottom track (Minors)

### Growth

#### Turn 1

![](/assets/images/Fangs%200-1.png)

G2 bottom; G3 Minor. 

Play 2, keeping 2 Plant+Animal and 1 Animal in hand. [[Ranging hunt]] movement only.


#### Turn 2

![](/assets/images/Fangs%200-2.png)

G2 bottom to unlock 3 CP; G4.

Play 3. [[Ranging hunt]] damage.


#### Turn 3

![](/assets/images/Fangs%200-3.png)

Reclaim, gain Minor; G2 bottom, unlocking Reclaim 1.

Play 3.


#### Turn 4

![](/assets/images/Fangs%200-4.png)

G2 bottom; G4. Reclaim [[Too near the jungle]] or another 0-cost.

Play 4.

#### Turn 5

![](/assets/images/Fangs%200-5.png)

Reclaim, gain Minor; G2 bottom to unlock 5CP and the second Reclaim 1; G4.

Play 5.

#### Turn 6

![](/assets/images/Fangs%200-5.png)

G3, gain Minor; G4. 

Play 5.

#### Turn 7 onwards

From turn 7 on, growth is G4 + any other, according to needs (G2 should only be selected if placing presence is necessary).

#### Remarks

Optionally, on turn 4-6 G2 can be taken from top until 2 Energy to unlock extra elements and more Energy/turn (**Bottom track hybrid**), but this is generally not recommended because extra elements can be gained with more card plays by playing 0-cost Powers, and extra Energy can be gained by selecting G4 (and possibly G3 on top of that). 

If you have found costly Minors, you might need to
delay the presence placement (and thus 5 CP) on turn 5, instead
taking G1+G4. In that case, turn 6 will be
G2+G3 or G2+G4.

### Pro and cons

Pros:

-   High card plays: 3 on turn 2, 5 on turn 5.
-   Unlock reclaim 1 on turn 3.
	-   This is very useful to either reclaim [[Too near the jungle]] as a 0-cost Plant+Animal to activate [[Ranging hunt]], or [[Prey on the builders]] against build-heavy adversaries such as England.

Cons:

- Very restricted in Energy.
- Little room for flexibility in growth.
	- In particular, the need for G4 means no room for G3, thus fewer Powers will be gained early.
- [[Ranging hunt]] cannot reliably be activated 
on both turn 3 and 4 unless a Plant and an Animal Minors have been found
(or a single Plant+Animal).
- Although Reclaim 1 is unlocked early, 
you often need to reclaim [[Too near the jungle]]
to unlock [[Ranging hunt]], as other Powers 
are too expensive and/or don't have good
enough elements, leaving little to no room
for flexibility in the reclaim choice.
