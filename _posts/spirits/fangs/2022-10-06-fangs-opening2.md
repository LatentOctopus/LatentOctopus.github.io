![](/assets/images/Fangs%200-3.png)

Play 3.


#### Turn 4

![](/assets/images/Fangs%200-4.png)

G2 bottom; G4. Reclaim [[Too near the jungle]] or another 0-cost.

Play 4.

#### Turn 5

![](/assets/images/Fangs%200-5.png)

Reclaim, gain Minor; G2 bottom to unlock 5CP and the second Reclaim 1; G4.

Play 5.

#### Turn 6

![](/assets/images/Fangs%200-5.png)

G3, gain Minor; G4. 

Play 5.

#### Turn 7 onwards

From turn 7 on, growth is G4 + any other, according to needs (G2 should only be selected if placing presence is necessary).

Optionally, on turn 4-6 G2 can be taken from top until 2 Energy to unlock extra elements and more Energy/turn (**Bottom track hybrid**), but this is generally not recommended because extra elements can be gained with more card plays by playing 0-cost Powers, and extra Energy can be gained by selecting G4 (and possibly G3 on top of that). 


### Stats

Turn | Growths | Owned cards | Cards in hand | Cumulative Energy
:--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: 
1 | 2, 3 |   5   | 5 | 2
2 | 2, 4 |   5   | 3 | 6
3 | 1, 2 |   6   | 6 | 6
4 | 2, 4 |   6   | 4 | 10
5 | 1, 2 |   7   | 7 | 10
6 | 3, 4 |   8   | 5 | 14
7 | 1, 4 |   9   | 7 | 17

### Pro and cons

Pros:

-   High card plays: 3 on turn 2, 5 on turn 5.
-   Unlock reclaim 1 on turn 3.
	-   This is very useful to either reclaim [[Too near the jungle]] as a 0-cost Plant+Animal to activate [[Ranging hunt]], or [[Prey on the builders]] against build-heavy adversaries such as England.

Cons:

- Very restricted in Energy.
- Little room for flexibility in growth.
	- In particular, the need for G4 means no room for G3, thus fewer Powers will be gained early.
- [[Ranging hunt]] cannot reliably be activated every turn: another Plant+Animal Minor is needed in the first 3 turns, or a 0-cost Plant from turn 4 onwards (both assume reclaiming [[Too near the jungle]], as [[Teeth gleam]] is too expensive to be played often).
