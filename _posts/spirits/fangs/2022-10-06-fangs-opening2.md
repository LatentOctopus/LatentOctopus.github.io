## Opening

### Growth

#### Turn 1

(((0-1)))

G2 bottom; G3 Minor, prioritise {{p}} over {{n}}.

Play 2, keeping 2 {{p}}{{n}} and 1 {{n}} in hand. Might activate [[Ranging hunt]] (movement only).


#### Turn 2

(((0-2)))

G2 bottom to unlock 3 CP; G4.

Play 3. [[Ranging hunt]] damage.


#### Turn 3

(((0-3)))

Reclaim, gain Minor, prioritising {{p}} if not found previously; G2 bottom, unlocking Reclaim 1.

Play 3.


#### Turn 4

(((0-4)))

G2 bottom; G4. Reclaim [[Too near the jungle]] or another 0-cost.

Play 4.

#### Turn 5

(((0-5)))

Reclaim, gain Minor; G2 bottom to unlock 5CP and the second Reclaim 1; G4.

Play 5.

#### Turn 6

(((0-5)))

G3, gain Minor; G4. 

Play 5.

#### Turn 7 onwards

From turn 7 on, growth is G4 + any other, according to needs (G2 should only be selected if placing presence is necessary).

#### Remarks

If a {{p}} but no {{n}} have been found, presence should be taken from the top track on turn 4 in order to unlock [[Ranging hunt]]. This delays 4 and 5 CP by one turn (the growth on turn 6 becomes G2+G4).

Optionally, on turn 4-6 presence can be taken from top until 2 Energy to unlock extra elements and more Energy/turn (**Bottom track hybrid**), to prepare for a late Major.Â However, this shouldn't be needed in most cases.

If you haven't found any 0-cost Minors by turn 5, you need to delay the presence placement (and thus 5 CP), instead
taking G1+G4. In that case, turn 6 will be G2+G3 or G2+G4.

### Stats

Turn | Growths | Owned cards | Cards in hand | CE | Ele+CP
:--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--:
1 | 2, 3 |   5   | 5 | 2 | 2
2 | 2, 4 |   5   | 3 | 6 | 3
3 | 1, 2 |   6   | 6 | 6 | 3
4 | 2, 4 |   6   | 4 | 10 | 4
5 | 1, 2 |   7   | 7 | 10 | 5
6 | 3, 4 |   8   | 5 | 14 | 5
7 | 1, 4 |   9   | 7 | 17 | 5

### Pros and cons

Pros:

-   High card plays: 3 on turn 2, 5 on turn 5.
-   Unlock reclaim 1 on turn 3.
	-   This is very useful to either reclaim [[Too near the jungle]] as a 0-cost {{p}}{{n}} to activate [[Ranging hunt]], or [[Prey on the builders]] against build-heavy adversaries such as England.

Cons:

- Can be tight in Energy if costly Minors have been gained.
- [[Ranging hunt]] cannot reliably be activated on both turn 3 and 4 unless a {{p}} and a {{n}} Minors have been found (or a single {{p}}{{n}}), or at least a {{p}} if delaying 4 CP by one turn by taking one presence from the top track.
- Although Reclaim 1 is unlocked early, you often need to reclaim [[Too near the jungle]] to unlock [[Ranging hunt]], as other Powers 
are too expensive and/or don't have good enough elements, leaving little to no room for flexibility in the reclaim choice.
