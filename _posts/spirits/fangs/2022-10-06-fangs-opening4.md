Use this opening if:

- You want to use [[Ranging hunt]] every turn.
- You want to add as many Beasts early on as you can, to increase [[Ranging hunt]] damage and flexibility in the mid and late game.
- Either [[Too near the jungle]] is enough to disrupt the Invader cycle, or you don't mind [[Ranging hunt]] being the only board-impacting Power you play in the first 3 turns.
- You don't mind reclaiming often.

Consider this opening especially against: 
- [Base] BP, Scotland, Russia.
- [Unconstrained] BP, Scotland, Habsburg Livestock, Russia, Habsburg Mining.

## Opening

The idea is to reclaim your Uniques early to play [[Teeth gleam]] and [[Too near the jungle]]
every turn. This enables using [[Ranging hunt]] every turn 
(except maybe turn 4 in case of exceptionally bad luck, i.e. no {{p}} found in 2 draws),
as well as placing lots of Beasts early on to scale better.

### Growth

#### Turn 1

(((1-0)))

G2 top; G4. 

Play [[Too near the jungle]] and [[Teeth gleam]].

#### Turn 2

(((1-1)))

Reclaim, gain Minor, prioritise {{p}}; G2 bottom.

Play [[Too near the jungle]] and either [[Teeth gleam]] or the Minor if it has {{p}}{{n}}.


#### Turn 3

(((1-2)))

Reclaim, gain Minor, prioritise {{p}} if not found; G2 bottom.

Play 3.


#### Turn 4

(((1-3)))

G2 bottom; G4.

Play 3.

#### Turn 5

(((1-4)))

Reclaim, gain Minor; G2 bottom.

Play 4.


#### Turn 6

(((1-5)))

G2 bottom to 5 CP; G4.

Play 5.


#### Turn 7 onwards

From turn 7 on, growth is G4 + any other, according to needs (G2 should only be selected if placing presence is necessary).

### Remarks

You will most likely have to always reclaim [[Too near the jungle]], as it provides good elements and you have to be very mindful of Energy.

### Pros and cons

Pros:

- Able to use [[Ranging hunt]] in all the first 3 turns.
- Playing [[Teeth gleam]] in all the first 2-3 turns allows to scale better into the mid game, thanks to the higher number of Beasts on the island.

Cons:

- Very energy-starved.
  - On turn 5+ it's impossible to play to max CP if no 0-cost Minors have been found.
  - More susceptible to Events.
- No flexibility in turn 1 card plays, and little to none in turn 2 and 3.
  - Harder to adapt to the board state.
  - The early game can be boring.
- Possibly little impact on the board in the first 3 turns outside of [[Ranging hunt]]
  - [[Teeth gleam]] does not affect Invaders directly, and [[Too near the jungle]] does little in cases where it cannot prevent a build.
