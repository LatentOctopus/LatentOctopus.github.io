# Opening: Top track hybrid (Mixed)

## Growth

### Turn 1

![](/assets/images/Fangs%201-0.png)

G2 top; G3 Minor.

Play [[Prey on the builders]] and [[Terrifying chase]], optionally swapping one of them for the new Minor. [[Ranging hunt]] movement only.

### Turn 2

![](/assets/images/Fangs%202-0.png)

G2 top; G3 Minor. 

Play 1 Plant+Animal and 1 Animal. [[Ranging hunt]] damage.

### Turn 3

![](/assets/images/Fangs%203-0.png)

G2 top; G3 Major (cost 2-5 is preferred) forgetting from discard, or Minor. 

Play 1 Plant+Animal and 1 Animal. [[Ranging hunt]] damage.

### Turn 4

![](/assets/images/Fangs%203-1.png)

Reclaim gaining Major if Major is bad or if previously gained Minor, otherwise gain Minor; G2 bottom. 

Play 2.

### Turn 5 onwards

From turn 5 on, growth is G2 bottom (unlocking 3 CP on turn 5) + any other, according to needs (taking G4 on turn 5 is recommended). Keep playing 1 Plant+Animal and 1 Animal every turn to activate [[Ranging hunt]], except Major turns if the Major is off-element.  
It may be worth to stop/delay putting presence down after unlocking 3CP or Reclaim1, and instead take multiple G1+G4 to keep playing a Major with threshold.

Optionally, presence can be taken from the top track until turn 5 to unlock 3 Energy (**"Full" top track**). This is generally not recommended, as it delays 3 CP until very late and the second Animal is not too useful; extra Energy can be gained using G4, if needed.

When drafting Minors, Animal is less of a priority the closer 3CP is (typically turn 5), as the 3rd card play doesn't need to have either. In general, 2 extra Animal (including 1 Plant+Animal if found) is enough.


## Stats

Cumulative Energy (* = assuming G4, ° = assuming reclaim): 2-4-7-8°-13*

Owned cards (* = gained Major and forgot another card): 5-6-6*-7-7

## Pro and cons

Pros: 

- Less variance in unlocking [[Ranging Hunt]]: from turn 2 onwards, only 1 Plant+Animal and 1 Animal is needed. This means that your starting hand alone is enough to activate your Innate for 2 turns without any reclaim.  
- Good energy income and low growth restrictions that allow for more flexibility.  
- Majors give Fangs a way to deal with blighted lands, which are otherwise not very accessible. Without Majors, Fangs can only deal with blighted lands via good Minor RNG (e.g. Dahan movement + Defend, or blight movement/removal), or with [[Terrifying chase]] if they don't have any City.

Cons:

- Low CP, only unlocking 3 on turn 5.  
- No reclaim 1 until turn 6 at the earliest.

# Alternative: Reclaim-heavy top track hybrid 

Recommended against: England.

The idea is to apply the (G3>G3) -› (G4>G1) growth swap to reclaim [[Prey on the builders]] often, which helps contain England's heavy building.

## Growth 

1. G2 top; G4.  
2. Reclaim, gain Minor; G2 top.  
3. G2 top to unlock E2; G4.  
4. Reclaim, gain Minor; G2 bottom.  
5. G2 bottom to unlock 3CP; G4.  
6. Reclaim, gain Major; G4.

From turn 6 onwards, the standard growth is G1+G4. If there is no need to reclaim use G3, or G2 (generally from bottom) if there is need to place presence.

Note that [[Prey on the builders]] can be played either in turn 2 or in 3, not both. If there is need to, G1+G4 can be selected on turn 3, delaying placing presence one turn.

## Stats

Cumulative Energy (* = assuming G4, ° = assuming reclaim): 4*-4°-9*-10°-15*-19*°-23*°  
Owned cards (* = gained Major and forgot another card): 4-5-5-6-6-6*-7
