The idea of top track openings is to have less variance in unlocking [[Ranging hunt]]: from turn 2 onwards, only 1 {{p}} and 2 {{n}} are needed. This means that your starting hand alone is enough to activate the Innate for 2 turns without any reclaim.

## Opening

### Growth

#### Turn 1

(((1-0)))

G2 top; G3 Minor.

Play 2. If you have found a {{p}}{{n}} Minor, you can unlock the damage threshold of [[Ranging hunt]] while still guaranteeing it next turn.

#### Turn 2

(((2-0)))

G2 top; G3 Minor. 

Play 1 {{p}}{{n}} and 1 {{n}}. [[Ranging hunt]] damage.

#### Turn 3

(((2-1)))

Reclaim, gain Minor; G2 bottom. 

Play 1 {{p}}{{n}} and 1 {{n}}. [[Ranging hunt]] damage.

#### Turn 4

(((2-2)))

G2 bottom to 3 CP; G4.

Play 1 {{p}}{{n}} and 1 {{n}}. [[Ranging hunt]] damage.

#### Turn 5 onwards

(((2-3)))

G2 bottom; G4 or G3 Minor.

Play 3.

From turn 6 on, select growth according to needs. Keep playing 1 {{p}}{{n}} and 1 {{n}} every turn to activate [[Ranging hunt]].

### Remarks

Be careful not to draft too many 1-cost Minors. This build can handle 1 or 2, but more than that will cause issues.

[[Too near the jungle]] is probably the best candidate to Reclaim every turn from 5 on, as it provides great elements for [[Ranging hunt]] at cost 0.

On turn 3, 2 energy/turn can be unlocked to pivot to a [Mixed strategy](/guide/fangs-opening3/).

### Stats

Turn | Growths | Owned cards | Cards in hand | CE
:--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: 
1 | 2, 3 |   5   | 5 | 2
2 | 2, 3 |   6   | 4 | 4
3 | 1, 2 |   7   | 7 | 4
4 | 2, 4 |   7   | 5 | 8
5 | 2, 4 |   7   | 3 | 12

### Pros and cons

Pros: 

- [[Ranging Hunt]] is used (with damage) every turn from turn 2 onwards. It is even possible to use it on turn 1, if a {{p}}{{n}} is found.
- Gaining 3 Minors in the first 3 turns improves the chances to find good ones early on (e.g blight control or good elements).

Cons:

- Only 2 CP until turn 4, and no reclaim 1 until turn 5 at the earliest.



## Variant: Early-reclaim top track (Minor Powers)

### Growth

1. G2 top; G4. Play [[Teeth gleam]] and [[Too near the jungle]] to deal damage with [[Ranging hunt]].
2. Reclaim, gain Minor; G2 top. Play 1 {{p}}{{n}} and 1 {{n}}.
3. G2 bottom; G3, gain Minor. Play 1 {{p}}{{n}} and 1 {{n}}.   
4. Reclaim, gain Minor; G2 bottom to 3 CP. Play 1 {{p}}{{n}} and 1 {{n}}.
5. G2 bottom; G4. Play 3.
   
From turn 6 onwards, select growth as needed.


### Stats

Turn | Growths | Owned cards | Cards in hand | CE
:--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: 
1 | 2, 4 |   4   | 4 | 4
2 | 1, 2 |   5   | 5 | 4
3 | 2, 3 |   6   | 4 | 6
4 | 1, 2 |   7   | 7 | 6
5 | 2, 4 |   7   | 4 | 10

### Pros and cons

Pros:

- Strong turn 1, being able to use [[Ranging hunt]] from the get-go, and every turn after that.

Cons:

- Lower energy means more susceptible to Events.
- Requires G4 on turn 1, thus having less chances to find a good Minor early on.
