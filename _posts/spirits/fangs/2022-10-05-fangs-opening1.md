Use this opening if:

- You want to use [[Ranging hunt]] consistently, except for maybe one of the first two turns (there is a chance you can use in in both turns with the standard opening, and it is guaranteed with the variant).
  - From turn 2 onwards, you only need to play 1 {{p}} and 2 {{n}}, therefore your starting hand alone is enough to activate the Innate for 2 turns without any reclaim.
- You want to gain many Powers early on, to maximise the chance to find useful ones (e.g. blight removal, defend, good elements, etc).
- You want to be able to pivot to a Major strategy if need be.
- You don't want to be forced to reclaim often.

Consider this opening especially against:

- [Base] BP, Sweden, France, Scotland, Russia.

## Opening

### Growth

#### Turn 1

(((1-0)))

G2 top; G3 Minor.

Play 2. You can play 2 {{p}}{{n}} to unlock the damage part of [[Ranging hunt]], but if you do you won't be able to do it in the next turn unless you have found or will find a {p}}{{n}} Minor.

#### Turn 2

(((2-0)))

G2 top; G3 Minor. 

Play 2.

#### Turn 3

(((2-1)))

Reclaim, gain Minor; G2 bottom. 

Play 1 {{p}}{{n}} and 1 {{n}}. [[Ranging hunt]] damage.

#### Turn 4

(((2-2)))

G2 bottom to 3 CP; G4.

Play 1 {{p}}{{n}} and 1 {{n}}. [[Ranging hunt]] damage.

#### Turn 5 onwards

(((2-3)))

G2 bottom; G4 or G3 Minor.

Play 3.

From turn 6 on, select growth according to needs. Keep playing 1 {{p}}{{n}} and 1 {{n}} every turn to activate [[Ranging hunt]].

### Remarks

You can swap G3 for G4 on turn 2, if you want to play 2 1-cost Powers in all the first 3 turns.

It is possible to use G2+G4 on turn 3, delaying Reclaiming until turn 4 but still activating [[Ranging hunt]], if desired.

If you don't take any G4 in the first 3 turns, be careful not to draft too many 1-cost Minors. This build can handle 1 or 2, but more than that will cause issues.

On turn 3, 2 energy/turn can be unlocked to pivot to a [Mixed strategy](/guide/fangs-opening3/).


### Stats

Turn | Growths | Owned cards | Cards in hand | CE | Ele+CP
:--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--:
1 | 2, 3 |   5   | 5 | 2 | {{n}}2
2 | 2, 3 |   6   | 4 | 4 | {{p}}{{n}}2
3 | 1, 2 |   7   | 7 | 4 | {{p}}{{n}}2
4 | 2, 4 |   7   | 5 | 8 | {{p}}{{n}}3
5 | 2, 4 |   7   | 3 | 12 | {{p}}{{n}}3

### Pros and cons

Pros: 

- [[Ranging Hunt]] is used (with damage) every turn from turn 2 onwards. It is even possible to use it on turn 1, if a {{p}}{{n}} is found.
- Gaining 3 Minors in the first 3 turns improves the chances to find good ones early on (e.g blight control or good elements).
- Good flexibility, being able to easily access more Energy if needed.

Cons:

- Only 2 CP until turn 4, and no reclaim 1 until turn 5 at the earliest.
- Can be tight in Energy in the first 3 turns.



## Variant: Early-reclaim top track (Minor Powers)

### Growth

1. G2 top; G3, gain Minor. Play [[Teeth gleam]] (or the minor if it has {{p}}{{n}}) and [[Too near the jungle]] to deal damage with [[Ranging hunt]].
2. Reclaim, gain Minor; G2 top. Play 1 {{p}}{{n}} and 1 {{n}}.
3. G2 bottom; G4. Play 1 {{p}}{{n}} and 1 {{n}}.   
4. Reclaim, gain Minor; G2 bottom to 3 CP. Play 1 {{p}}{{n}} and 1 {{n}}.
5. G2 bottom; G4. Play 3.
   
From turn 6 onwards, select growth as needed.


### Stats

Turn | Growths | Owned cards | Cards in hand | CE | Ele+CP

Cons:

- Lower energy means more susceptible to Events.
