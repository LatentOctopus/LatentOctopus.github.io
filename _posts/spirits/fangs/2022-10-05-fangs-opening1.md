The idea of top track openings is to have less variance in unlocking [[Ranging hunt]]: from turn 2 onwards, only 1 {{p}} and 2 {{n}} are needed. This means that your starting hand alone is enough to activate the Innate for 2 turns without any reclaim.

Another advantage is that the higher Energy gain granted by unlocking 2 Energy/turn allows to play low- and mid-cost Majors. Majors give Fangs a way to deal with blighted lands, which are otherwise less accessible. Without Majors, Fangs can only deal with blighted lands via [[Terrifying chase]] if they don't have any City, or with some Minors (e.g. Dahan movement + Defend, or blight movement/removal). Although Fangs can get many Minors, which reduces RNG variance, bad luck might still make it hard to deal with blighted lands.

## Top track hybrid (Mixed)

### Growth

#### Turn 1

(((1-0)))

G2 top; G3 Minor.

Play 2.

#### Turn 2

(((2-0)))

G2 top; G3 Minor. 

Play 1 {{p}}{{n}} and 1 {{n}}. [[Ranging hunt]] damage.

#### Turn 3

(((3-0)))

Reclaim, gain Major (cost 2-5); G2 top. 

Play 1 {{p}}{{n}} and 1 {{n}}. [[Ranging hunt]] damage.

#### Turn 4

(((3-1)))

G2 bottom; G4.

Play the Major and another card.

#### Turn 5 onwards

(((3-2)))

G2 bottom to 3CP; G3 Minor.

Play 3.

From turn 6 on, select growth according to needs. Keep playing 1 {{p}}{{n}} and 1 {{n}} every turn to activate [[Ranging hunt]], except Major turns if the Major is off-element.

### Remarks

If the Major is bad, it might be worth playing 1 {{p}}{{n}} and 1 {{n}} for [[Ranging hunt]] damage on turn 4, and Reclaim on turn 5 to replace it (it could be replaced with G3, but this would leave no options on what to play on turn 5).

It's a good idea to unlock the Reclaim 1 on your bottom track on turn 6 or 7, but outside of that you won't normally need the rest of your tracks -- 4 CP will likely cost too much to be sustained when paired with a Major, and the rest of your top track is not too useful. Therefore, G3 or G4 will generally be better options than G2. It may be worth to take multiple G1+G4 to keep playing the Major, especially if you can threshold it.

### Stats

Turn | Growths | Owned cards | Cards in hand | CE
:--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: 
1 | 2, 3 |   5   | 5 | 2
2 | 2, 3 |   6   | 4 | 4
3 | 1, 2 | **6** | 6 | 5
4 | 2, 4 |   6   | 4 | 10
5 | 2, 3 |   7   | 3 | 13

### Pros and cons

Pros: 

- [[Ranging Hunt]] is used (with damage) every turn from turn 2 onwards, outside perhaps one turn when playing the Major on 2 CP.
  - It is even possible to use it on turn 1, if a {{p}}{{n}} is found.
- Gaining 2 Minors in the first 2 turns improves the chances to find good ones early on (e.g blight control or good elements).

Cons:

- Only 2CP until turn 5, and no reclaim 1 until turn 6 at the earliest.
- If the first Major is bad, it cannot be replaced until turn 5 without sacrificing Energy gain.


## Variant: early-reclaim top track (Mixed)

### Growth

1. G2 top; G4. Play [[Teeth gleam]] and [[Too near the jungle]] to deal damage with [[Ranging hunt]].
2. Reclaim, gain Minor; G2 top. Play 1 {{p}}{{n}} and 1 {{n}}.
3. G2 top to to 2E; G3, gain Minor. Play 1 {{p}}{{n}} and 1 {{n}}.   
4. Reclaim, gain Major; G2 bottom. Play 1 {{p}}{{n}} and 1 {{n}}.
5. G2 bottom to 3CP; G4. Play 3.
  - If the Major is bad, it can be replaced with G3 instead of G4.
   
From turn 6 onwards, select growth as needed.


### Stats

Turn | Growths | Owned cards | Cards in hand | CE
:--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: 
1 | 2, 4 |   4   | 4 | 4
2 | 1, 2 |   5   | 5 | 4
3 | 2, 3 |   6   | 4 | 7
4 | 1, 2 | **6** | 6 | 8
5 | 2, 4 |   6   | 4 | 13

### Pros and cons

Pros:

- Strong turn 1, being able to use [[Ranging hunt]] from the get-go.
- Most reliable way to always have [[Ranging hunt]] on: it's activated for the first 4 turns, and since 3 CP are available from turn 5, it's likely that it will be activated even when playing the Major.

Cons:

- First Major is only gained on turn 4, and is only played on turn 5 (not to mention it might need to be replaced).


## Variant: early Major (Majors)

### Growth

1. G2 top; G3 Minor. Play the Minor/[[Terrifying chase]] and 1 more.
2. G2 top; G3 Major (cost 2-5). Play 1 {{p}}{{n}} and 1 {{n}}.
3. G2 top to to 2E; G4. Play the Major and 1 more.  
4. Reclaim, gain Minor (or replace Major); G2 bottom. Play 1 {{p}}{{n}} and 1 {{n}}.
5. G2 bottom to 3CP; G4 (or G3 Minor if Energy is not needed). Play the Major and 2 more.
   
From turn 6 onwards, select growth as needed.

### Remarks

When you gain the Major on turn 2, Forget from discard. The best options are usually either the Minor gained on turn 1, or [[Terrifying chase]]. If the Major does not have {{n}}, this will make activating [[Ranging hunt]] on turn 3 impossible, but playing a Major should compensate for it.

If the first Major is bad, consider Reclaiming on turn 3 to replace it sooner, rather than playing it.

Optionally, presence can be taken from the top track until turn 5 to unlock 3 Energy (**"Full" top track**). This is generally not recommended, as it delays 3 CP until very late and the second {{n}} is not too useful; extra Energy can be gained using G4, if needed.

### Stats

Turn | Growths | Owned cards | Cards in hand | CE
:--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: 
1 | 2, 3 |   5   | 5 | 2
2 | 2, 3 | **5** | 4 | 4
3 | 2, 4 |   5   | 2 | 9
4 | 1, 2 |   6   | 6 | 10
5 | 2, 4 |   6   | 4 | 15

### Pros and cons

Pros:

- Getting a Major on turn 2 means that it can be played on turn 3, or redrawn on turn 4.

Cons:

- Less reliable at activating [[Ranging hunt]].
