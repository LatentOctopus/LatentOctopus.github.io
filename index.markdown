Welcome to Spirit Island Guides! Here you 
can find guides containing my thoughts 
about general concepts and openings 
for a variety of Spirits, as well as links
 to similar resources that I like on other 
websites.

### Why should you listen to me?

No reason in particular! I am a level 6 
(difficulty 8-11) solo player like many 
other out there. I don't do impressive
 things like playing double 6 Adversaries
 or play 6 Spirits at once, and I don't 
generally have exceptional win rates. 
I just like to analyse, theorycraft and
 learn how to improve and I started taking
 notes, so I thought that I could share 
those with other people. Some of the 
guides are more tentative, some other 
are more established, but all of them
 are subject to change as I gain more 
experience with the Spirit -- you never 
stop learning! Hopefully you'll find at 
least some of them useful :)

### Who are these guides for?

As I said above, this website is more similar
to sharing my notes than to explicitly teach
other players (for example, I won't generally
provide basic advice like "stop the Invaders
 cycle early"). As a result, I think the
people that are going to get the most out of it
are medium-high difficulty players that want 
some pointers about what
works for a Spirit, and start from there to
find what strategy works best for them.
With that being said, everyone is welcome here,
and I might decide to add a "Beginner tips"
 section 
in the future if that's going to be useful!
