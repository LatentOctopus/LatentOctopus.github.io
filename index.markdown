Welcome to Spirit Island Guides! Here you can find guides containing my thoughts about general concepts and openings for a variety of Spirits, as well as links to similar resources that I like on other websites.

#### Why should you listen to me?

No reason in particular! I am a level 6 (difficulty 8-11) solo player like many other out there. I don't do impressive things like playing double 6 Adversaries or play 6 Spirits at once, and I don't generally have exceptional win rates. I just like to analyse, theorycraft and learn how to improve and I started taking notes, so I thought that I could share those with other people. Some of the guides are more tentative, some other are more established, but all of them are subject to changing as I gain more experience with the Spirit -- you never stop learning! Hopefully you'll find at least some of them useful :)
